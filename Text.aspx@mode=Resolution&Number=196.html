<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>196. Taco Bell Boycott <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, all people have been created in the image of God, redeemed through Jesus Christ, and called to share in a ministry of reconciliation that shapes our world according to God&rsquo;s intention of shalom;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, fasting is a sign of repentance as well as a spiritual practice that helps us to see God&rsquo;s vision for our world more clearly and to identify the grave injustices around us, refraining from patronage in response to unjust practices can likewise be an act of repentance through which we acknowledge and take responsibility for our participation and complicity in such injustice and act with God to transform our world;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, in Globalization and its Impact on Human Dignity and Human Rights, our church has stated that &ldquo;[m]igrant workers continue to be discriminated against and abused, especially those who are undocumented in their host countries. Women migrants are particularly vulnerable to exploitation especially when they work in gender-specific jobs that consign them to various forms of sexual, domestic, and menial work. Studies show that the majority of migrants are uprooted because of the lack of jobs at home or because jobs pay extremely low wages. While globalization has spawned more capital and spurred greater production, workers&rsquo; wages have been kept low and below a livable wage even in those countries whose governments have a prescribed minimum wage&rdquo;; <br> Whereas, &ldquo;[m]igrants&rsquo; rights are human rights. It is tragic when migrants, whose rights&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> have already been violated in their home countries, find their human rights also violated in their foreign host countries. Invoking host country laws rarely works in their favor; <br> Whereas, we have urged governments to ratify and implement the United Nations International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families. This Convention will be an instrument to protect, secure, and ensure the human rights of migrant workers and their families; <br> Whereas, the Immokalee farm workers earn sub-poverty wages for picking tomatoes used in Taco Bell food products. According to the Department of Labor, their average wage (40 cents per 32 pound bucket) has not changed in more than twenty years; <br> Whereas, some farm workers picking tomatoes have been held in debt-bondage slavery;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, farm workers are not covered by the National Labor Relations Act, which means that unemployment and workers&rsquo; compensation benefits have been systematically denied to them. Farm labor policies, such as the current guestworker/H2A visa program, which allows agricultural workers temporary entrance into the U.S., have severely diminished the limited protections afforded farm workers. This type of program keeps real wages down; maintains substandard working conditions; eliminates workers&rsquo; rights to voice grievances; and denies workers their civil rights, including the fundamental right of freedom of movement. Farm work is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States, placing workers at a higher risk of injury and therefore blocking access to the means other workers have for addressing workplace problems; <br> Whereas, the Coalition of Immokalee Workers (CIW) has called for a consumer boycott of Taco Bell restaurants and products; <br> Whereas, the 214</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) and the Twenty-third General Synod of the United Church of Christ have endorsed this consumer boycott;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, the NCCC through its policy statements, resolutions and the accompaniment of the National Farm Worker Ministry has consistently supported the right of farm workers in their efforts to win just wages and working conditions and a voice in the workplace; <br> Whereas, at the November 2002 meeting of the NCCC Executive Board unanimously called for the issues behind the Taco Bell boycott to be reviewed and reported to the next meeting of the Executive Board;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, at the February 2003 meeting the NCCC Executive Board voted to study the issues behind the boycott and invite the member communions similarly to study the issues by: (a) using resources prepared by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), the United Church of Christ, the National Farm Worker Ministry, and the Coalition of Immokalee Workers; (b) speaking with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and with Emil Brolick, president of Taco Bell; and (c) prayerfully engaging these issues from their own tradition&rsquo;s teachings and witness so as to be prepared to make a recommendation on the boycott to the General Assembly for action at the November 2003 meeting; <br> Whereas, in February 2003 the Executive Board of the National Council of Churches of Christ, of which The United Methodist Church is an active member, unanimously adopted a resolution of support of and pastoral concern for the CIW workers who were on a hunger strike outside of Taco Bell&rsquo;s worldwide office in Irvine, CA; <br> Whereas, General Secretary Robert Edgar designated Noelle Damico of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) to dialogue on his behalf with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers and with Emil Brolick, president of Taco Bell about the NCCC&rsquo;s Executive Board&rsquo;s resolution; <br> Whereas, Mr. Brolick has not until now responded to either Rev. Edgar&rsquo;s verbal request for a meeting with Noelle Damico nor has he responded to Rev. Edgar&rsquo;s written request of February 2003, requesting an appointment for himself and the heads of the Council&rsquo;s member denominations at Mr. Brolick&rsquo;s earliest convenience to discuss issues related to the boycott;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp; Whereas, on Ash Wednesday 2003 the General Secretary, President, and President Elect of the NCC sent a letter respectfully requesting that the workers cease their hunger strike and allow the church to carry forward their struggle that was copied to Mr. Brolick; <br> &nbsp; Whereas, member communions have been prayerfully engaging this issue from their own traditions&rsquo; teachings and witness and with information provided by the NCCC;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Therefore be it resolved,</i> that 2004 General Conference of The United Methodist Church joins the CIW&rsquo;s boycott of Taco Bell restaurants and products until such time as Taco Bell <br> 1. convenes serious three-way talks between the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, representatives of Taco Bell, and their tomato suppliers to address exploitation and slavery in the fields,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 2. contributes to an immediate increase in farm worker wages through an increase in the per pound rate it pays for tomatoes, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. works with the CIW, tomato industry representatives, and tomato suppliers to establish a code of conduct that would ensure workers&rsquo; fundamental labor rights by defining strict wage and working condition standards required of all Taco Bell suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the Council of Bishops in consultation with the General Board of Church and Society, name a monitoring committee that will be responsible to assess the progress and the status of the negotiations between Taco Bell and CIW.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Be it finally resolved,</i> that the monitoring committee be empowered to recommend the end of the boycott when the above-mentioned criteria are met or the workers call for an end to the boycott. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶163<i>B</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
