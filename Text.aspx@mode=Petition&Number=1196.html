and <i>furthermore</i>, that UNSC 242 also calls for &ldquo;achieving a just settlement of the refugee problem&rdquo; and for guarantees of &ldquo;the territorial inviolability and political independence of every State in the area,&rdquo; and <br /> WHEREAS: The Israeli government has since 2000 tendered its acceptance in principal of a nation for the Palestinian people in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and <i>recognizing</i> that since then, successive governments of the Palestinian Authority have refused to agree, and <i>furthermore recognizing</i> that any sovereignty by the Palestinians over the West Bank will necessarily require a resolution to the issue of Israeli settlements there in a manner acceptable to the Palestinians, and <br /> WHEREAS: There is not now a single governing authority of the Palestinian people because of the absence of Palestinian Authority in the Gaza Strip, which is ruled by Hamas, and <i>recognizing</i> that Hamas has been named a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union even though Hamas was elected in Gaza, consolidating its power through lethal violence, and <i>recognizing with concern</i> that Hamas continues to advocate the destruction of the state of Israel and continues to launch attacks against Israeli civilians from within Gaza,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED that the United Methodist Church: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from Palestinian areas to be accomplished according to benchmarks established by agreement of both sides. <br /> f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The governments of Israel and the Palestinians effectively to exercise control over persons or groups among their societies who conduct aggressive violence against the other, to prevent such acts of violence and to prosecute those who carry them out.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></td>
