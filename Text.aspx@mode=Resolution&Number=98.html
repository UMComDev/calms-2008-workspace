<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>EDUCATION <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>98. Education, The Gift of Hope <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, John Wesley was a &ldquo;unique and remarkable educator (who) gave to the whole Methodist movement . . . a permanent passion for education&rdquo;</sub><sup>1</sup></sub>, and <br> &nbsp; 1. <i>The Story of Methodism,</i> Halford E. Luccock, Paul Hutchinson, Robert W. Goodloe (Abingdon Press, 1926; page 361). <br> &nbsp; Whereas, Wesley believed that persons develop their full God-given potential when they educate their mind as well as nurture their spirit; and <br> Whereas, the historic United Methodist concern for education is witnessed through commitment to educational opportunity for all persons regardless of gender or ethnic origin, or economic or social background; and <br> Whereas, this commitment continues as United Methodist individuals, congregations, colleges, campus ministries, and other groups become involved in local education in their communities; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, these efforts make a significant contribution to furthering access, advancing and enhancing student learning, and advocating for the continued improvement of educational opportunity; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, educators, families, and communities are concerned about substance abuse and violence in our schools and communities, along with other social problems which undermine the safety of children and the quality of their lives in school and in society at large; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, United Methodists have a moral concern to take initiatives to support and create alliances involving educators, community leaders, and students to address the challenges of contemporary<br> education and to work to resolve the threats to quality education; and <br> Whereas, the 1996 General Conference of The United Methodist Church received <i>Education: The Gift of Hope,</i> a study of the historic and current United Methodist concern for education, and urged every local church to use the study to understand our historic educational concern and to become enlivened in educational partnerships in the local community; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry has revised <i>Education: The Gift of Hope</i>, to address concerns about drugs and violence in our schools and to further remind United Methodists of the Wesleyan challenge to become involved in local efforts in education; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that every local United Methodist congregation is encouraged to study <i>Education: The Gift of Hope</i> to learn of our heritage and concern; and <br> &nbsp; <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that each local congregation develop a strategy for being in partnership with local educators, community leaders, and students in providing a positive, safe, helpful, and hopeful environment in which students can live and learn and grow. <br> </i></i><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>D</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
