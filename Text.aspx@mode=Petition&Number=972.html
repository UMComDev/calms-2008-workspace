The following procedures are presented for the protection of the rights of individuals guaranteed under Section III, Article IV, of our Constitution and for the protection of the Church. The presumption of innocence shall be maintained until final resolution of each written complaint. Special attention should be given to ensuring racial, ethnic, and gender diversity of boards, committees, and courts and the timely disposition of all matters.<br /> <br /> Just Resolution of Written Complaints - Processes that seek a just resolution are encouraged at any time, including through administrative or judicial proceedings. If a process seeking a just resolution is used, the appropriate persons, including the respondent, the counsel for the Church and the counsel for the respondent, should enter into a written agreement outlining such process, including any agreement on confidentiality. If resolution is achieved, a written statement of resolution, including terms and conditions, shall be signed by all participants. The parties shall agree on any matters to be disclosed to third parties.<br /> &nbsp; <br /> 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>The following rights commence at the time a written complaint is received by the resident <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bishop, and continue until final resolution of the complaint is achieved: <br /> </i><br /> (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In any proceeding devolving from the receipt of a written complaint, the respondent (the person against whom the administrative complaint has been filed) shall have a right to be heard before any action is taken. <br /> <br /> (B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to a meeting at which a written complaint is to be presented to the respondent, there must be reasonable agreement as to the scheduling of time and place of the meeting; or, if not possible, at least 72 hours notice. At that meeting the respondent must be informed of his/her fair process rights. No substantive discussion of the issues in the written complaint or a proposed resolution may be discussed at this meeting. <br /> <br /> (C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice of any hearing shall advise the respondent of the reason for the proposed procedures with sufficient detail to allow the respondent to prepare a response. Notice shall be given not less than twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent shall have a right to be accompanied by a clergyperson in full connection to any hearing, in accordance with the appropriate disciplinary provisions. The clergyperson accompanying the respondent shall have the right to voice. <br /> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The respondent shall have access to all records relied upon the determination of the outcome of the complaint resolution process. <br /> <br /> <i>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to the above, the following rights commence once a complaint is referred&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; from the supervisory process by the resident bishop to Counsel for the Church or to the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Committee of the Board of Ordained Ministry that deals with Conference relations: <br /> </i><br /> (A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the resident bishop deems that a written complaint cannot be resolved through the process of supervisory response, s/he shall refer the complaint, in accordance with ¶33 to (a) Justpeace UMC for assistance in bringing about a just resolution; or b) to either (1) the committee of the Board of Ordained Ministry that deals with Conference Relations in the case of administrative complaints, or (2) to an appointed counsel for the Church ( ¶2704.2) in the case of judicial complaints. These bodies are the representatives of the ordained ministers in full connection who have sole right to vote on matters of character and conference relations. ( ¶33) <br /> <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any meeting or hearing, under no circumstances shall one party, in the absence of the other party, discuss substantive issues with members of the pending hearing body. Questions of procedure may be raised with either the presiding officer of the hearing body or its secretary. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No bill of charges shall be certified by any committee on investigation after an earlier bill of charges has been certified by a committee on investigation based on the same alleged chargeable offenses, even if those offenses are related to the same or similar occurrences. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Healing</i><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a part of the complaint resolution process, the bishop and cabinet, in consultation with the presiding officer of the pending hearing, trial, or appellate body then sitting, shall provide for healing if there has been significant disruption to the congregation, the annual conference, or the context of ministry by the judicial matter. This may include a just resolution process for unresolved conflicts, support for victims, and reconciliation for all who are involved. This process may also include the sharing of information by the bishop or a cabinet member about the nature of the complaint without disclosing alleged facts underlying the complaint that might compromise the judicial process. <br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Failure To Respond/Appear</i><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that a clergyperson fails to appear for supervisory interviews, refuses mail, refuses to communicate personally with the bishop or district superintendent, or otherwise fails to respond to supervisory requests or requests from official administrative committees, such actions or inactions shall not be used as an excuse to avoid or delay any Church processes, and such processes may continue without the participation of such individual.<br /> <br /> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Immunity from Prosecution</i><br /> In order to preserve the integrity of the Church&rsquo;s administrative process and ensure full participation in it at all times, the bishop, cabinet, BOM, witnesses, advocates, administrative review committee, elders voting in executive session, and all others who participate in the Church&rsquo;s administrative process shall have immunity from prosecution of complaints brought against them related to their role in a particular administrative process, unless they have committed a chargeable offense in conscious and knowing bad faith. The complainant/plaintiff in any proceeding against any such person related to their role in a particular judicial process shall have the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that such person&rsquo;s actions constituted a chargeable offense committed knowingly in bad faith. The immunity set in this provision shall extend to civil court proceedings, to the fullest extent permissible by the civil laws.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>To consolidate the existing two Statements of Fair Process into one statement and to codify relevant Judicial Council decisions already made. <br /> <br /></p></td>
