Yet sanctions as political and economic tools of pressure and leverage can play a critical role in the mitigation and deterioration of conflicts. It is in this sense that sanctions are sometimes seen as a more tolerable alternative to war.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The humanitarian crisis in Darfur is well documented. The United Methodist Church has called repeatedly for action to end this crisis, and has worked hard to alleviate suffering on the ground. Additional steps are needed to bring economic pressure on the government of Sudan to end the genocide.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The Sudanese government is susceptible to well-placed economic pressure because of its dependence upon direct foreign investment. For example, in 2002 when the Canadian company Talisman led others oil companies in withdrawing from Sudan the Khartoum regime entered into negotiations that finally ended the country's 21-year civil war. According to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, a project of the Genocide Intervention Network, "divestment is still likely to disproportionately affect the government of Sudan since Khartoum allocates little government revenue towards social spending." Most development and relief programs are financed largely by international humanitarian concerns. Therefore, a targeted divestment from companies doing business with the Sudanese government is unlikely to harm those in need.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> U.S. government policy has eased most investment restrictions related to South Sudan, while maintaining a ban on oil investment in the entire country. Such targeted divestment promotes strict criteria for oil companies throughout Sudan, but otherwise relaxes standards for most other kinds of investment necessary in South Sudan. Companies that provide agricultural, consumer and educational products and services also engage in commerce that benefits the people of Sudan directly. Investment in these corporations provide positive alternatives to those whose products and services are primarily consumed by the government and military forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The United Methodist Church should not own or profit from companies whose products or services are used by corrupt governments or regimes to murder, suppress, or displace it citizens and neighbors. Therefore, we ask every United Methodist to prayerfully consider divestment of the personal and pension assets under their control from any company doing business with the government of Sudan, and request that other investment managers such as mutual fund companies, pension plans and bank trustees do the same. </b><br /> <i>[see petition 80836]</i><br /> </b></b><br /></p></td>
