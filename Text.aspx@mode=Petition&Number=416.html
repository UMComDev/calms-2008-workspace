An updated<b> </b><strike> reassessment report was</strike>&nbsp; <strike> due in 2002. Despite recommendations from the Science Advisory Board that the report be finalized</strike> , <strike> EPA had not released the final report to the public at the time of this writing.</strike>&nbsp; <b>document was issued in 2003 titled<u> </u>Exposure and Human Health Reassessment of 2, 3, 7, 8, Tetrachlorodibenazo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and Related Compounds.</b> <strike> However, based on the<b> </strike> Like the</b> October 2001 draft <b>reviewed and released</b> by panels, the conclusion remained the same: dioxin should be classified as a known carcinogen<b> </b>- a view shared by the international community as expressed by WHO and within the United States through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the National Institute of Health&rsquo;s National Toxicology Program. <strike> Exposure to toxic chemicals such as dioxin is widely suspected to be related to the continued high rates of cancer in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rate of testicular cancer has doubled in the past thirty years, the rate of prostate cancer has doubled in the past ten years, and the rate of breast cancer in the United States has risen from one in every twenty women in the 1960s to one in every eight women today.&nbsp;&nbsp;More women have died of breast cancer in the last two decades than the number of U.S. soldiers killed in World War I, World War II, and the Korean and Vietnam wars.</strike>&nbsp; <b>In October 2004 (EPA) asked the National Research Council (NRC) of the National Academies to review the 2003 draft. After receiving comments from (NRC) in 2005, EPA completed its Reassessment and characterized TCDD as carcinogenic to humans.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July 2006 the NRC issued a report on the 2005 completed report entitled Health Risks from Dioxin and Related Compounds (Evaluation of the EPA Reassessment).&nbsp;&nbsp;In that report the (NRC) Committee unanimously agreed on a classification for TCDD of at least &ldquo;likely to be carcinogenic to humans.&rdquo; The Committee agrees with EPA in classifying other dioxins and DLCs as &ldquo;likely to be carcinogenic to humans.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Amend sixth paragraph of Background section as follows: <br /> <b>Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. women. Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in U.S. women. It accounts for nearly one out of three cancers diagnosed in U.S. women. </b>The EPA concluded that the levels of dioxins already lodged in human bodies are already close to levels known to cause serious health problems. According to the EPA, the average person is exposed to dioxin levels 50 to 100 times greater than the maximum allowable amounts designated by the federal government in 1985.<br /></b></b></p></td>
