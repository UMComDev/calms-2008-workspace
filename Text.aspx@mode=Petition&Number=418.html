(¶ 607); and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, according to the <strike> 2000</strike>&nbsp; <b>2006</b> United States <strike> census</strike>&nbsp; <strike> analysis</strike>&nbsp; <b>Census Bureau estimate</b>, <strike> the people group in the United States called Hispanic/Latino-Latina has increased 58 percent from 1990 to 2000 and is projected to be 25 percent of the United States population by 2040</strike>&nbsp;the Hispanic/Latino<b>-Latina</b> population has surpassed 44 million; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, these figures represent an undercount and do not reflect information about undocumented persons; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, according to the General Board of Global Ministries Office of Research's analysis of the census data, every annual conference of The United Methodist Church in the United States has within its boundaries a growing Hispanic/Latino-Latina population;

<b>ministries </b>with Hispanic/Latino-Latina communities by the whole church; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, in direct relationship to the implementation of the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino<strike> -Latina</strike>&nbsp;Ministry, <strike> 600</strike>&nbsp;faith communities have been established <strike> in 52 conferences</strike> , <strike> 900</strike>&nbsp;lay missioners have been equipped and deployed, <b>missionaries have been commissioned and assigned,</b> <strike> 75 </strike> new Hispanic/Latino-Latina congregations have been started <strike> in 35 conferences</strike> , <strike> 70</strike>&nbsp;existing Hispanic/Latino-Latina churches <strike> in 35 conferences</strike>&nbsp;have been strengthened, and <strike> 900</strike>&nbsp;outreach ministries have been established <strike> in 52 conferences</strike> ;

and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, these figures represent an undercount due to difficulties in reporting the number of Hispanic/Latino-Latina members in multicultural churches and non-Hispanic/Latino-Latina congregations, and the number of Hispanic/Latino-Latina congregations sharing facilities with other ethnic and cultural churches; and due to difficulties in the lack of reports from some Hispanic/Latino-Latina congregations; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, in spite of the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino<strike> -Latina</strike>&nbsp;Ministry and other missional efforts, advances and success in reaching the <strike> people group called</strike>&nbsp;Hispanic/Latino-Latina <b>population </b>and the increased presence of Hispanic/Latino-Latina persons in the United Methodist connectional system, the <strike> people group in the United States called</strike>&nbsp;Hispanic/Latino-Latina <b>population </b>represents a huge mission field, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Therefore, be it resolved</i>, that <strike> by December 31, 2006,</strike>&nbsp;every annual conference in the United States <strike> shall</strike>&nbsp; <b>be challenged to </b>develop a strategic, comprehensive plan for Hispanic/Latino<strike> -Latina</strike>&nbsp;ministries within its boundaries, <strike> and this plan</strike>&nbsp; <b>which </b>will include, but not be limited to, socio-economic, cultural, and religious analysis of the Hispanic/Latino-Latina communities that will be served;

<b>will</b> provide support and consultation in the development of the plans. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ADOPTED 2004 <br /> <b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶161.</b><br /></p></td>
