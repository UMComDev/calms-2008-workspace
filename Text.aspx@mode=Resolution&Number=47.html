<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>47. Assisting Personal Mobility <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the International Organization of Mobility Providers estimates that some 22 million persons worldwide lack personal mobility because of land mines, polio, wartime injuries, and a host of other causes, and <br> Whereas, these persons usually live in dire poverty, are marginalized from society, hidden away in back rooms, and are often seen as embarrassments, and <br> Whereas, these persons of God&rsquo;s creation often live lives of misery and discomfort, &ldquo;scuttling around on the ground like crabs&rdquo; (the description of a missionary in Congo), eating the dust and mud of streets and trails, looking at people&rsquo;s feet, and <br> Whereas, such persons seldom have an adequate social life, being unable to attend school, go to church, visit relatives, or attend community events, and <br> Whereas, they long to be productive members of society, but must depend on others for mobility, and <br> Whereas, mobility devices are available that can provide for these persons a degree of mobility giving to them the fullness of human dignity, comfort, hope and productivity they deserve, and <br> Whereas, personal mobility should be a human right for all of God&rsquo;s people, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved</i>, that the next quadrennium shall be declared a time to focus on the need for providing personal mobility as an act of justice and compassion; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved</i>, that every entity of The United Methodist Church respond generously with time and resources: to analyze the mobility needs in their community and other parts of the world; to collaborate with people in need of enhanced mobility and with organizations involved with them; and to seek appropriate ways to address needs that have been identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>G</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
