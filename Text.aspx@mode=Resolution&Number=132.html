<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>132. Confession to Native Americans <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the gospel calls us to celebrate and protect the worth and dignity of all peoples; and <br> Whereas, the Christian churches, including The United Methodist Church and its predecessors, have participated in the destruction of Native American people, culture, and religious practices; and <br> Whereas, the churches of this country have not sufficiently confessed their complicity in this evil; and <br> Whereas, the churches have been blessed by having members who are Native Americans as well as by engaging in dialogue with Native Americans who practice their traditional religions; and <br> Whereas, confession of our guilt is a first step toward the wholeness that the churches seek through the ecumenical movement; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the United Methodist General Conference confesses that The United Methodist Church (and its predecessor bodies) has sinned and continues to sin against its Native American brothers and sisters and offers this formal apology for its participation, intended and unintended, in the violent colonization of their land; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church pledges its support and assistance in upholding the American Indian Religious Freedom Acts (P.L. 95-134, 1978) and within that legal precedent affirms the following: <br> 1. the rights of the native peoples to practice and participate in traditional ceremonies and rituals with the same protection offered all religions under the Constitution of the United States of America; <br> &nbsp; 2. access to and protection of sacred sites and public lands for ceremonial purposes; and <br> 3. the use of religious symbols (feathers, tobacco, sweet grass, bones, and so forth) for use in traditional ceremonies and rituals. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Conference recommends that local churches develop similar statements of confession as a way of fostering a deep sense of community with Native Americans and encourages the members of our Church to stand in solidarity on these important religious issues and to provide mediation when appropriate for ongoing negotiations with state and federal agencies regarding these matters. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> Readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
