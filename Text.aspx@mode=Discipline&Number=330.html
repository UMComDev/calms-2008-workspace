<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>330.</b> <i>Requirements for Ordination as Deacon and Admission to Full Connection</i>-Probationary members who are applying for admission into full connection and who have been probationary members for at least three full annual conference years following the completion of the educational requirements for ordination as a deacon may be admitted into membership in full connection in an annual conference by two-thirds vote of the clergy members in full connection of the annual conference, upon recommendation by two-thirds vote of the board of ordained ministry, after they have qualified as follows:<br> <b> </b>1. Served under episcopal appointment in a ministry of service the entire probationary period. Upon recommendation of the board of ordained ministry, the annual conference may equate less than fulltime or nonsalaried service as meeting this qualification. Such equivalence is to be determined in light of the years of service involved, the quality of that service, the maturity of the applicant, and other relevant factors determined by the board. Supervision is to be: <i>(a)</i> by the district superintendent, and <i>(b)</i> by the board of ordained ministry. The applicant&rsquo;s service must be evaluated by the board of ordained ministry as effective according to written guidelines developed by the board and adopted by the clergy members in full connection. Lay persons directly involved in the applicant&rsquo;s servant ministry shall be involved by the board in the annual evaluation. <br> 2. Been previously elected as a probationary member. <br> 3. Responded to a written or oral doctrinal examination administered by the board of ordained ministry. The candidate shall demonstrate the ability to communicate clearly in both oral and written form.

The examination shall also focus upon the covenantal relationship of the applicant to God, to the Church, and to the Order of Deacon, as well as the understanding of <i>diaconia,</i> servant leadership, and the interrelatedness of the Church and the world. The applicant shall be able to articulate the call of God to the order of deacon and to relate that call to leadership within the ministry of all Christians, through the setting of their service, the local church, and the annual conference. <br> 4. The following questions are guidelines for the preparation of the examination: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a</i>) Theology. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How has the practice of ministry affected your experience and understanding of God? <br> (2) What effect has the practice of ministry had on your understanding of humanity and the need for divine grace? <br> (3) What changes has the practice of ministry had on your understanding of <i>(a)</i> the &ldquo;Lordship of Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and <i>(b)</i> the work of the Holy Spirit? <br> (4) The United Methodist Church holds that Scripture, tradition, experience, and reason are sources and norms for belief and practice, but that the Bible is primary among them.

What are the marks of the Christian life? <br> (6) For the sake of the mission of Jesus Christ in the world and the most effective witness to the Christian gospel, and in consideration of your influence as an ordained minister, are you willing to make a complete dedication of yourself to the highest ideals of the Christian life; and to this end will you agree to exercise responsible self-control by personal habits conducive to physical health, intentional intellectual development, fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness, integrity in all personal relationships, social responsibility, and growth in grace and the knowledge of the love of God?</sub><sup>11</sup></sub><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) What is the meaning and significance of the sacraments? <br> (8) Describe the nature and mission of the Church. What are its primary tasks today? <br> (9) What is your understanding of: <i>(a)</i> the kingdom of God;<i> (b)</i> the Resurrection; <i>(c)</i> eternal life? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b</i>) Vocation. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How do you understand your vocation as an ordained deacon? <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c</i>) The Practice of Ministry. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) How has the practice of service ministry during the probationary period affected your understanding of ministry? <br> (2) Do you offer yourself to be appointed by the bishop to a service ministry? <br> (3) Describe and evaluate your personal gifts for ministry. What would be your areas of strength and areas in which you need to be strengthened? <br> (4) Are you willing to relate yourself in ministry to all persons without regard to race, color, ethnicity, national origin, social status, gender, sexual orientation, age, economic condition, or disabilities? <br> (5) Provide evidence of experience in peace and justice ministries. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d)</i> <i>Historic Examination for Admission into Full Connection and Ordination as Deacon</i>-The bishop as chief pastor shall engage those seeking to be admitted in serious self-searching and prayer to prepare them for their examination before the conference.

Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed. Never trifle away time; neither spend any more time at any one place than is strictly necessary. <br> <i>(b)</i> Be punctual. Do everything exactly at the time. And do not mend our rules, but keep them; not for wrath, but for conscience&rsquo; sake. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;5.

Following election, the bishop and secretary of the conference shall provide a certificate of full membership in the annual conference, and following ordination, a certificate of ordination. <br> 6.
