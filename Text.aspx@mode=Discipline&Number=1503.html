Subject to the continuing control and direction of the General Conference of The United Methodist Church as set forth from time to time in the <i>Discipline, </i>the general board is authorized and empowered to cause the operations of the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits to be carried on and the general authorizations defined in ¶&nbsp;1504 to be achieved in such manner, through or by means of such agencies or instrumentalities, and by use of such procedures as the general board may from time to time determine to be necessary, advisable, or appropriate, with full power and authority in the premises to take all such action and to do all such other acts and things as may be required or found to be advisable. In particular, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the general board is authorized and empowered, for the purposes of this paragraph: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> To use, manage, operate, and otherwise utilize all property and assets of every kind, character, and description of any corporation(s) created by the general board pursuant to ¶&nbsp;1503.2 below, as well as all income from such property and assets and the avails thereof, all with liability or obligation to account for such property and assets, the use thereof, the income therefrom, and avails thereof only to the General Conference of The United Methodist Church. <br> <i>b)</i> To cause a corporation(s) created by the general board pursuant to ¶&nbsp;1503.2 to take all such action and to do all such things as the general board may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the intent and purposes of this paragraph. The governing body of said corporation(s) from time to time shall take all action that the general board deems necessary or advisable to carry out the intent and purpose of this paragraph, unless local law would require such governing bodies to make independent decisions with respect to particular actions. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.

A majority of the members of the governing bodies shall be elected from the membership of the general board. <br> <i>f)</i> The legal entities created under this paragraph are agencies or instrumentalities through which the denomination known as The United Methodist Church provides benefits, investment services, and other services outlined in ¶&nbsp;1504 below in the name of the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;
