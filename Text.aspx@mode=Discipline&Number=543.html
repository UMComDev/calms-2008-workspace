<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>543.</b> <i>Powers and Duties</i>-1. To a central conference shall be committed for supervision and promotion, in harmony with the <i>Discipline</i> and interdenominational contractual agreements, the missionary, educational, evangelistic, industrial, publishing, medical, and other connectional interests of the annual conferences, provisional annual conferences, missionary conferences, and missions within its territory and such other matters as may be referred to it by said bodies or by order of the General Conference; and it shall provide suitable organizations for such work and elect the necessary officers for the same. <br> 2. A central conference, when authorized by a specific enabling act of the General Conference, may elect one or more bishops from among the traveling elders of The United Methodist Church. The number of bishops to be elected by each central conference shall be determined from time to time by the General Conference. <br> 3. When a central conference shall have been authorized to elect bishops, such elections shall be conducted under the same general procedure as prevails in the jurisdictional conferences for the election of bishops. A central conference shall have power to fix the tenure of bishops elected by the said central conference.</sub><sup>13 <br> </sup></sub>4. A central conference shall participate in the General Episcopal Fund on payment of its apportionment at the same percentage basis as that fixed for Annual Conferences in Jurisdictional Conferences. The General Council on Finance and Administration shall determine the apportionment amounts for the annual conferences of the central conferences for the succeeding quadrennium based on calculation methodology approved by the General Conference upon recommendation by the Council. This determination shall be informed by consultation with the Council of Bishops. <br> 5. A central conference, in consultation with the bishops of that central conference, shall fix the episcopal areas and residences and make assignments to them of the bishops who are to reside in that central conference. The bishops of a central conference shall arrange the plan of episcopal visitation within its bounds. <br> 6. A central conference shall have authority to elect and support general officers in all departments of the work of the Church within the boundaries of the central conference but may not determine the number of bishops. <br> 7. A central conference shall have power to make such changes and adaptations of the <i>Book of Discipline</i> as the special conditions and the mission of the church in the area require, especially concerning the organization and administration of the work on local church, district, and annual conference levels; <i>provided</i> that no action shall be taken that is contrary to the Constitution and the General Rules of The United Methodist Church; and <i>provided</i> that the spirit of connectional relationship is kept between the local and the general church. Subject to this restriction, a central conference may delegate to an annual conference within its boundaries the power to make one or the other of the changes and adaptations referred to in this paragraph, upon the request of such annual conference.</sub><sup>14</sup></sub><br> 8. A central conference shall fix the boundaries of the annual conferences, provisional annual conferences, missionary conferences, and missions within its bounds, proposals for changes first having been submitted to the annual conferences concerned as prescribed in the <i>Discipline </i>of The United Methodist Church. No annual conference shall be organized with fewer than thirty-five clergy members except as provided by an enabling act for the quadrennium, which shall not reduce the number below twenty-five. Nor shall an annual conference be continued with fewer than twenty-five clergy members except as provided by an enabling act for the quadrennium.</sub><sup>15</sup></sub><br> 9. A central conference may advise its annual conferences and provisional annual conferences to set standards of character and other qualifications for admission of lay members. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;10. A central conference shall have power to make changes and adaptations in procedure pertaining to the annual, district, and charge conferences within its territory and to add to the business of the annual conference supplementary questions considered desirable or necessary to meet its own needs. <br> 11. A central conference shall have authority to examine and acknowledge the journals of the annual conferences, provisional annual conferences, missionary conferences, and missions located within its bounds and to make rules for the drawing up of the journals as may seem necessary. <br> 12. A central conference shall have authority to adopt rules of procedure governing the investigation and trial of its clergy, including bishops, and lay members of the Church and to provide the necessary means and methods of implementing the said rules; <i>provided,</i> however, that the ordained ministers shall not be deprived of the right of trial by a clergy committee, and lay members of the Church of the right of trial by a duly constituted committee of lay members; and <i>provided</i> also, that the rights of appeal shall be adequately safeguarded.</sub><sup>16 <br> </sup></sub>13. A central conference is authorized to prepare and translate simplified or adapted forms of such parts of the Ritual as it may deem necessary, such changes to require the approval of the resident bishop or bishops of the central conference. <br> 14. A central conference shall have the power to conform the detailed rules, rites, and ceremonies for the solemnization of marriage to the statute laws of the country or countries within its jurisdiction. <br> 15. Subject to the approval of the bishops resident therein, a central conference shall have the power to prescribe courses of study, including those in the vernaculars, for its ministry, both foreign and indigenous, including local preachers, lay speakers, Bible women, deaconesses, teachers-both male and female-and all other workers whatsoever, ordained or lay. It shall also make rules and regulations for examination in these courses. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;16. A central conference shall have authority to edit and publish a central conference <i>Discipline,</i> which shall contain in addition to the Constitution of the Church such sections from the general <i>Discipline</i> of The United Methodist Church as may be pertinent to the entire Church and also such revised, adapted, or new sections as shall have been enacted by the central conference concerned under the powers given by the General Conference. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;17. In a central conference or provisional central conference using a language other than English, legislation passed by a General Conference shall not take effect until twelve months after the close of that General Conference in order to afford the necessary time to make adaptations and to publish a translation of the legislation that has been enacted, the translation to be approved by the resident bishop or bishops of the central conference. This provision, however, shall not exclude the election of delegates to the General Conference by annual conferences within the territory of central conferences or provisional central conferences. <br> 18. A central conference is authorized to interpret Article XXIII of the Articles of Religion (<i>page 65</i>) so as to recognize the governments of the country or countries within its territory. <br> 19. A central conference shall have power to authorize the congregations in a certain state or country to form special organizations in order to receive the acknowledgment of the state or country according to the laws of that state or country. These organizations shall be empowered to represent the interests of the Church to the authorities of the state or country according to the rules and principles of The United Methodist Church, and they shall be required to give regular reports of their activities to their respective annual conferences. <br> 20. A central conference may, with the consent of the bishops resident in that conference, enter into agreements with churches or missions of other denominations for the division of territory or of responsibility for Christian work within the territory of the central conference. <br> 21. A central conference shall have the right to negotiate with other Protestant bodies looking toward the possibility of church union; <i>provided</i> that any proposals for church union shall be submitted to the General Conference for approval before consummation.</sub><sup>17 <br> </sup></sub>13. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 311, 430. <br> 14. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 313. <br> </sup></sub>15. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 525, 541, 549. <br> 16. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 310, 595. <br> 17. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 350. <br>
