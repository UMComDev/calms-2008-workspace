<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>582.</b> <i>Organization</i>-A provisional annual conference shall be organized in the same manner and have the same powers and functions as an annual conference, subject to the approval of the presiding bishop; and its members shall share <i>pro rata</i> in the proceeds of The United Methodist Publishing House with members of the annual conferences, with the following exceptions: <br> 1. The bishop having episcopal supervision of a provisional annual conference in a foreign or a home mission field may appoint a representative as <b>superintendent,</b> to whom may be committed specific responsibility for the representation of the General Board of Global Ministries in its relation to the indigenous church and also in cooperation with other recognized evangelical missions. Such duties shall be exercised so as not to interfere with the work of the district superintendent. This superintendent may also be a district superintendent; <i>provided</i> the superintendent is a member of the said conference. The superintendent shall be responsible directly to the bishop appointed to administer the work in that episcopal area and shall make adequate reports of the work and needs of the field to the bishop and to the secretaries of the General Board of Global Ministries immediately concerned. <br> 2. A provisional annual conference shall meet annually at the time appointed by the bishop. If there is no bishop present, the superintendent shall preside. In the absence of both, the presidency shall be determined as in an annual conference (¶&nbsp;603.6). The conference or a committee thereof shall select the place for holding the conference. <br> 3. In a provisional annual conference receiving major funding from the General Board of Global Ministries, the assigned staff of the board shall provide consultation and guidance in setting up the annual budget and Advance projects within the conference and in the promotion of new mission projects. The conference, in making requests for appropriations for support, including grants and loans for building projects, shall submit to the General Board of Global Ministries a statement of the proposed annual budget and proposed financial plan for new mission and building plans. Items involving increased appropriations from the General Board of Global Ministries or increased askings from the Advance shall be subject to modifications by the General Board of Global Ministries. <br> 4. A provisional annual conference shall elect one ordained minister and one layperson as delegates with full voting and other rights<br> to the General Conference and to the jurisdictional conference. Delegates to central conferences shall be elected in accordance with<br>¶&nbsp;541.1. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
