Today, workers whose hands gather the fruits of God&rsquo;s good earth are among <br /> the most marginalized &ndash; both economically and socially &ndash; in our communities. As the <br /> cries of the harvesters continue, we are called as a church to respond. <br /> Farm workers are the men women and children who climb for our apples, oranges and <br /> peaches, stoop for our cucumbers and strawberries, and dig for our sweet potatoes. <br /> Eighty-five percent of fruits and vegetables in the United States are handpicked by <br /> some of the nation&rsquo;s most vital workers, essential to the economic well-being of the <br /> United States. While conditions have improved for some farm workers through <br /> successful, and long-fought, organizing campaigns, the majority of farm workers <br /> continue to struggle with low wages, minimal legal protections, and unhealthy work <br /> environments. <br /> The average wage of the more than two million farm workers in the United States is <br /> $11,000. In some areas workers earn significantly less, often paid by piece rate earning <br /> as little as forty cents per bucket of tomatoes or sweet potatoes collected. Women may <br /> receive less pay than men for the same work and face sexual discrimination, harassment <br /> and abuse by crew leaders who control their jobs. <br /> Agriculture is consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous occupations in the <br /> United States. Farm workers face pesticide risks and suffer from the highest rate of <br /> toxic chemical injuries and skin disorders of any workers in the country. Women who <br /> work in the fields have given birth to babies with severe birth defects, attributed by <br /> many to pesticide exposure. In recent years, workers across the United States have died <br /> in fields nationwide from heat exposure combined with lack of drinking water, shade or <br /> breaks. <br /> Farm workers face numerous obstacles to receiving health care including lack of <br /> transportation, lack of paid sick leave and risk of job loss if they miss work; only ten <br /> percent of farm workers report having employer-provided health insurance. <br /> Most farm workers are immigrants who have come to the United States to seek a better <br /> life for their families. Many here today were once farmers in their own countries who <br /> have been driven from their land, unable to compete with the price of subsidized crops <br /> from the United States. At their workplace and in communities in which they live here, <br /> these workers face discrimination and exploitation based on ethnicity, socioeconomic <br /> and immigration status. An increasing number of farm workers arrive through the H2- <br /> A guest worker program, some from as far away as Thailand. Isolated in remote labor <br /> camps without transportation, these workers are in particular need of outreach, <br /> support, and ministry from the community. <br /> Farm workers were excluded from federal laws passed in the 1930&rsquo;s to protect workers, <br /> such as the National Labor Relations Act and those mandating overtime pay and <br /> minimum wage. Few states require overtime pay for farm workers and minimum wage <br /> statutes apply to workers on large farms only. Laws designed to protect farm workers <br /> are often not enforced. Furthermore, workers often fear firing or deportation if they <br /> speak up about abuses. <br /> Farm workers call on us to stand in solidarity with them to change unjust conditions <br /> and scripture calls us to respond. As Christians, we cannot sit silently as our brothers <br /> and sisters are exploited and abused. We proclaim our outrage at their living and <br /> working conditions. Following the teachings of Christ we must ensure that the men and <br /> women who harvest our food are invited to share fully in the fruits of their labor. <br /> The United Methodist Church: <br /> </b></ul><li><b>publicly denounces any and all mistreatment of farm workers and repents of <br /> any complicity that we hold as consumers and often-silent participants in and <br /> beneficiaries of an exploitive food production and distribution system; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>demands that employers treat farm workers and their families with dignity and <br /> respect; and that corporate processors, food retailers, and restaurants take <br /> responsibility for the treatment of the farm workers in their supply chains; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>calls on the General Board of Church and Society, the General Board of Global <br /> Ministries, annual conferences, and local churches to support state and federal <br /> legislation that would strengthen the laws protecting farm workers' rights and <br /> provide the funding necessary for adequate enforcement of laws protecting farm <br /> workers rights, health and safety; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>celebrates that farm worker organizing campaigns have resulted in labor <br /> agreements producing significant change in farm workers lives, including wage <br /> increases, benefits, pesticide protection and treatment with respect; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>commits itself to work in cooperation with the National Farm Worker Ministry <br /> whose primary mission is supporting farm workers organizing for justice and <br /> empowerment; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>urges annual conferences, especially where farm workers live and work, to use <br /> personal and institutional resources to encourage recognition of farm workers&rsquo;<br /> rights\ to a voice in the agricultural industry, including representation and good <br /> faith bargaining; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>urges local churches to identify and reach out to farm workers in their <br /> communities, including those in the H2-A guest worker program; <br /> </b></ul><li><b>urges local churches to hold a yearly service to remember and honor farm <br /> workers, including worship, education and a call to action; and <br /> </b></ul><li><b>urges the United Methodist Committee on Relief to consider the needs of farm <br /> workers when administering relief efforts; <br /> See Social Principles, Â¶ 163H. <br /> </b><br /></p></td>
