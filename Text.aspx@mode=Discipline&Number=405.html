<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b>Section III. Election, Assignment, and Termination of Bishops <br> </b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>¶&nbsp;405. <i>Provisions for Episcopal Areas in Jurisdictions</i>-1. In central conferences, the number of bishops shall be determined on the basis of missional needs, as approved by the General Conference on recommendation of the Commission on Central Conference Affairs. <br> 2. In all other conferences, the number of bishops shall be determined on the following basis: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a</i>) Each jurisdiction having 500,000 church members or fewer shall be entitled to six bishops, and each jurisdiction having more than 500,000 church members shall be entitled to one additional bishop for each 320,000 church members or major fraction thereof; provided, however, that in those jurisdictions where this requirement would result in there being an average of more than 55,000 square miles per episcopal area, such jurisdiction shall be entitled to six bishops for the first 400,000 church members or fewer and for each additional 290,000 church members or two-thirds thereof shall be entitled to one additional bishop. <br> <i>b</i>) A jurisdiction shall not have the number of bishops to which it is entitled reduced until and unless the number of its church members shall have decreased by at least ten percent below the number of church members which had previously entitled the jurisdiction to its number of bishops. <br> <i>c</i>) If the number of church members in a jurisdiction shall have decreased by at least ten percent below the number of church members which had previously entitled the jurisdiction to its number of bishops, then the number of bishops to which it shall be entitled shall be determined on the basis of missional needs, as approved by the General Conference on the recommendation of the Interjurisdictional Committee on Episcopacy; provided however that said jurisdiction shall be entitled to no less than the number of bishops to which it would be entitled under subparagraph <i>a)</i> above. <br> <i>d</i>) If a jurisdiction, as a result of the provisions of this paragraph, shall have the number of bishops to which it had previously been entitled reduced, then the reduction in the number of bishops to which it is entitled shall be effective as of September 1 of the fourth calendar year after said reduction has been determined by the General Conference. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. This legislation shall take effect immediately upon adjournment of the 2000 General Conference. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
