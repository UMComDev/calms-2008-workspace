Definition of Clergy <br /> Clergy in The United Methodist Church are individuals who serve as <strike> commissioned ministers,</strike>&nbsp;deacons, elders, and local pastors under appointment of a bishop (full- and part-time), who hold membership in an annual conference, and who are <strike> commissioned,</strike>&nbsp;ordained<strike> , </strike> or licensed. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ¶303.3. Ordained persons exercise their ministry in covenant with all Christians, especially with those whom they lead and serve in ministry. They also live in covenant of mutual care and accountability with all those who share their ordination, especially in The United Methodist Church, with the ordained who are members <b>in full connection </b>of the same annual conference and part of the same Order. The covenant ... <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ¶304.4. The United Methodist Church entrusts those persons who are in the ordained ministry with primary responsibility for maintaining standards of education and preparation for ordination. Having been originally recommended by a charge conference and by authorization of the ordained members in full connection with the annual conference, according to the procedures set out in the Book of Discipline for the examination and approval of candidates for ordination, persons are <b>ordained by the bishop and </b>elected to membership in the annual conference <strike> and ordained by the bishop</strike> . <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ¶311.3.d)(2) a notarized statement certifying that this candidate has neither been accused in writing nor convicted of a felony, <strike> misdemeanor</strike>&nbsp; <b>misdemeanor</b>, any incident of sexual misconduct, or child abuse. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Section IV. License for Pastoral Ministry <br /> ¶ 315. License for Pastoral Ministry <br /> All persons <strike> not ordained as elders</strike>&nbsp; <b>who have not been elected to full membership in an annual conference as elders </b>who are appointed to preach and conduct divine worship and perform the duties of a pastor shall have a license for pastoral ministry. The board of ordained ministry (¶ 634.2g) may recommend to the executive session of the annual conference the licensing of those persons who are: <br /> 1. Probationary members <strike> commissioned by</strike>&nbsp; <b>of </b>the annual conference, or <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Section (NEW) The Ordained Deacon <br /> ¶ 324. The Ministry of a Deacon <br /> From among the baptized, deacons are called by God to a lifetime of servant leadership, authorized by the Church, and ordained by a bishop. Deacons fulfill servant ministry in the world and lead the Church in relating the gathered life of Christians to their ministries in the world, interrelating worship in the gathered community with service to God in the world. Deacons give leadership in the Church's life: in the teaching and proclamation of the Word; in worship, and in assisting the elders in the administration of the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper; in forming and nurturing disciples; in conducting marriages and burying the dead; in the congregation's mission to the world; and in leading the congregation in interpreting the needs, concerns, and hopes of the world. It is the deacons, in both person and function, whose distinctive ministry is to embody, articulate, and lead the whole people of God in its servant ministry. From the earliest days of the church, deacons were called and set apart for the ministry of love, justice, and service; of connecting the church with the most needy, neglected, and marginalized among the children of God. This ministry grows out of the Wesleyan passion for social holiness and ministry among the poor. <br /> Deacons lead the congregation in its servant ministry and equip and support all baptized Christians in their ministry. The distinct ministry of the deacon has evolved in United Methodism over many years&mdash;the continuing work of the deaconess, the home missionary, and the diaconal minister. The Church, recognizing the gifts and impact of all predecessor embodiments of the diaconate and providing for the continuation of the office of deaconess, affirms that this distinctiveness is made visible and central to the Church's life and ministry through ordination and that the ministry of the deacon is a faithful response of the mission of the Church meeting the emerging needs of the future. Deacons are accountable to the annual conference and the bishop for the fulfillment of their call to servant leadership. <br /> ¶ 325. Ministry, Authority, and Responsibilities of Deacons <br /> Deacons are persons called by God, authorized by the Church, and ordained by a bishop to a lifetime ministry of Word and Service to both the community and the congregation in a ministry that connects the two. Deacons exemplify Christian discipleship and create opportunities for others to enter into discipleship. In the world, the deacon seeks to express a ministry of compassion and justice, assisting laypersons as they claim their own ministry. In the congregation, the ministry of the deacon is to teach and to form disciples, and to lead worship together with other ordained and laypersons. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ¶ 326. Requirements for Ordination as Deacon <br /> Persons who are applying for ordination as a deacon must be approved by two-thirds vote of the clergy members in full connection of the annual conference, upon recommendation by two-thirds vote of the board of ordained ministry, after they have qualified as follows: <br /> 1. Met all the requirements for election to probationary membership as a deacon as specified in ¶329.<br /> 5. A qualified person who has completed the requirements for deacon's orders and been approved by the annual conference shall be eligible for ordination as deacon by a bishop. Following ordination, the bishop and secretary of the conference shall provide a certificate of ordination. A deacon shall be ordained by a bishop by the laying on of hands, employing the Order of Service for the Ordination of Deacons. The bishops shall be assisted by other deacons and may include laity designated by the bishop representing the Church community and representatives of other Christian communions, in the laying on of hands.</b><strike> <br /> <b></strike> <br /> </b><br /> <b>Section NEW. The Ordained Elder <br /> ¶ 327. Ministry of an Elder <br /> Elders are ordained ministers who, by God's grace, have completed their formal preparation and have been found by the Church to be of sound learning, of Christian character, possessing the necessary gifts and evidence of God's grace, and whose call by God to ordination has been confirmed by the Church. Elders are ordained to a lifetime ministry of Service, Word, Sacrament, and Order. When their period of probationary service has been completed they are authorized to preach and teach the Word of God, to administer the sacraments of baptism and Holy Communion, and to order the life of the Church for mission and ministry. The servant leadership of the elder is expressed by leading the people of God in worship and prayer, by leading persons to faith in Jesus Christ, by exercising pastoral supervision in the congregation, and by leading the Church in obedience to mission in the world. <br /> As members of the Order of Elder, all elders in full connection are in covenant with all other elders in the annual conference and shall participate in the life of their Order. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ¶ 328. Requirements for Ordination as Elder <br /> Candidates for ordination as elders must be approved for elder's ordination by two-thirds vote of the clergy members in full connection of the annual conference, upon recommendation by two-thirds vote of the board of ordained ministry after they have qualified as follows: <br /> 1. Met all the requirements for election to probationary membership as an elder as specified in ¶329.<br /> 2. A qualified person who has completed the requirements for elder's orders and been approved by the annual conference shall be eligible for ordination as elder by a bishop. Following ordination, the bishop and secretary of the conference shall provide a certificate of ordination. An elder shall be ordained by a bishop by the laying on of hands, employing the Order of Service for the Ordination of Elders.
