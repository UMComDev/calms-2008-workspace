We also respect those who support the use of force, but only in extreme situations and only when the need is clear beyond reasonable doubt, and through appropriate international organizations.&rdquo; (paragraph 164-I, Discipline) and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, The United Methodist Church has expressed its concern about the war in Iraq by stating: &ldquo;by attacking Iraq without the approval and participation of the United Nations, the United States has squandered its positive reputation as a responsible member of the global community ... &ldquo; (page 850 of the 2004 Book of Resolutions.) and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore be it resolved that The United Methodist Church affirms its commitment to uphold in prayer all military personnel, their families, and all the people of Iraq, even as we pray and work for a speedy and just resolution of the war in Iraq; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved that we express our respect and prayers for all who choose to serve in the military and for those who, for reason of conscience, seek to separate from the military, and for those who refuse to serve in the war in Iraq while retaining their place in the military; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved that we call upon the government of the United States and its partners in the Iraq war to provide full support and services for as long as needed for returning veterans, especially for those wounded in body, mind, and spirit by their experiences in the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such support should include medical treatment, appropriate counseling, training for employment, and a generous pension for those who are not able to provide a living for themselves and their families; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved that we call upon the United States and its partners in the war in Iraq, in cooperation with the other willing nations, to provide the resources for rebuilding the infrastructure of Iraq, especially the medical system, so that the citizens of Iraq who were injured or damaged in the war will receive the full support and services needed to resume their lives; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Finally be it resolved that the Secretary of the General Conference send a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, to the Vice-President, to the Secretary of State, to the Secretary of Defense, to the leadership of both houses of Congress and to United Sates ambassador to the United Nations.</b><br /></p></td>
