<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>151. Organ and Tissue Donation <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, selfless consideration for the health and welfare of all persons is at the heart of the Christian ethic; and <br> Whereas, organ and tissue donation is a life-giving act, since transplantation of organs and tissues is scientifically proven to save the lives of persons with terminal diseases and improve the quality of life for the blind, the deaf, and persons with life-threatening illnesses; and <br> Whereas, organ donation may be perceived as a positive outcome of a seemingly senseless death and is thereby comforting to the family of the deceased and is conducted with respect, and with the highest consideration for maintaining the dignity of the deceased and his or her family; and <br> Whereas, moral leaders the world over recognize organ and tissue donation as an expression of humanitarian ideals in giving life to another; and <br> Whereas, thousands of persons who could benefit from organ and tissue donation continue to suffer and die due to lack of consent for donation, due primarily to poor awareness and lack of an official direction from the church,<i><br> Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church recognizes the life-giving benefits of organ and tissue donation and thereby encourages all Christians to become organ and tissue donors by signing and carrying cards or driver&rsquo;s licenses, attesting to their commitment of such organs upon their death to those in need, as a part of their ministry to others in the name of Christ, who gave his life that we might have life in its fullness. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1984<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>U</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
