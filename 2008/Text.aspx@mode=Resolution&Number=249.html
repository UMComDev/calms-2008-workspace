<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>249. Transforming Injustices in Criminal Justice Systems <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The Social Principles of The United Methodist Church state: &ldquo;In the love of Christ, who came to save those who are lost and vulnerable, we urge the creation of a genuinely new system for the care and restoration of victims, offenders, criminal justice officials and the community as a whole.&rdquo; Deeply rooted racial and economic injustices in most nations&rsquo; criminal justice systems form barriers to the realization of this vision. These problems include: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>media&rsquo;s disproportionate portrayal of poor people and people of color as criminals; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> legislation that results in ever-increasing rates of arrests and longer sentencing of the poor and people of color; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> disproportionate rates of incarceration of poor people and people of color; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> racial profiling and arrest quota systems; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> prosecutors and judges who have too much discretion and too few unbiased guidelines on whom they will prosecute and incarcerate; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> court-appointed legal representation for poor people that is often inferior to that available to those who can afford private representation; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> prisons that have become warehouses for the poor and people of color; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> privatization of prisons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> prisons that fail to provide educational programs and/or employment training to prisoners, thus contributing to recidivism. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We call upon The United Methodist Church at all levels to: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>increase awareness, through resources and educational opportunities, of the realities outlined above, as well as possibilities for just alternatives; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> create and sustain new ministries of justice and involve United Methodist churches in advocacy for the elimination of racism and classism in the criminal justice system; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> work in states and local communities for specific systemic changes, including: <br> </li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reducing poverty by improving educational systems, creating affordable housing and dignified employment opportunities; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promoting equity in courts by legal representation of equal quality regardless of financial ability;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calling for a moratorium on building prisons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-assessing incarceration guidelines and reducing incarceration of persons guilty of non-violent crimes; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reversing the trend toward privatization and profit-making of prisons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing high-quality education and training programs in prisons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; creating laws against discrimination against ex-offenders; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; re-instating voting rights for ex-offenders; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eliminating mandatory sentences for drug-related crimes; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; developing guidelines for police officers, prosecutors, and judges that result in less subjective exercise of authority; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; educating media and the public about realities of poverty and race, so that the poor and people of color cease being portrayed as criminals and potential criminals. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We further call upon the General Board of Global Ministries, through the Restorative Justice Ministries program, to give leadership to the above actions through educational and training opportunities and resources, and to promote these concerns and activities throughout the denomination&rsquo;s general agencies, annual conferences, districts, and local churches. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 164<i>G</i> and <i>H</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
