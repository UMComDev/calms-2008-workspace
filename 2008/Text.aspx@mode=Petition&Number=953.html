Leave of Absence <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>-- This relationship is granted to clergy who are local pastors and probationary, associate, and full members who choose to take a break from a ministry on a temporary basis. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The pastor&rsquo;s request should be made at least a hundred twenty (120) days prior to annual conference and is presumed to be for the following year. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If the pastor needs to take the break sooner, the Cabinet shall review the reasons with the pastor and work out the ad interim time. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The clergy session of the annual conference shall vote whether or not to grant the leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;For that reason, an exit and re-entrance interview with the Board of Ordained Ministry&rsquo;s proper committee is in order. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. To return to appointment, the pastor must give six (6) months notice before annual conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Cabinet may grant an appointment between annual conference sessions if the pastor requests it and the Cabinet can work it out. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. While on leave, the pastor shall choose a charge conference of a church in the conference of residence and, if residing outside the annual conference of membership, shall also choose a charge conference in the annual conference of membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual report of pastoral activities is to be turned in to the charge conference(s) as well as district superintendent(s) related thereto and to the Board of Ordained ministry of the annual conference of membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;While the <br /> pastor on leave is under the supervision of the pastor of the charge conference of residence, pastoral activity is not restricted to the church of the charge conference. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. If living outside the conference of membership during the leave, the pastor may seek affiliate membership in the annual conference of membership.&nbsp;&nbsp;Involvement in boards, committees, and agencies of either conference is up to the respective nominating committees and the availability of the pastor on leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;The right to vote at conference shall be in the conference of membership only.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> 7. While on leave, other than availability and other rights indicated here, the pastor retains all rights and responsibilities as stated in Paragraph 334. <br /> 8. For a leave of more than five consecutive years, the conference must support the request by a two-thirds majority. <br /> 9. The standing of leave of absence shall not be used as a punishment nor as a form of suspension since both are coerced.&nbsp;&nbsp;Leave of absence is purely voluntary. <br /> </b>[In addition, the changes indicated here need to be taken into account in ¶362 of the Book of Discipline.] <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Leave of absence is thoroughly onerous even for those on voluntary leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary leave has been used as a threat to get pastors to &ldquo;voluntarily&rdquo; take leave, to dump pastors on the street without a hearing, or to extend suspensions of pastors which have run out.&nbsp;&nbsp;This law must change. <br /></p></td>
