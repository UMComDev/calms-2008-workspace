This is the greatest and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as you love yourself. On these two commandments hang all the <u><i>LAW</u></i> and the prophets&rdquo; (Matthew&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 22:37-40); and <br /> Whereas, Torah, the law, is understood by the Jewish people to be &ldquo;a living encounter with God allowing God to be known and felt and continues to be God&rsquo;s love letter to God&rsquo;s children&rdquo; (Aaron 26-27); and <br /> Whereas, Torah, the Law, states that God is at work in all aspects of life-social, economic, political, and military-so issues of moral accountability will regularly surface (Birch 260); and <br /> Whereas, Prophets proclaimed and interpreted their understandings of Torah requirements for different generations of Israelites, especially at critical moments in Israel&rsquo;s history; and <br /> Whereas, Prophets were seen to be the word of God to the people of God<u>,</u> and that the greatest crisis in Israel would be to lose the word to lead and guide them in their lives, &ldquo;They shall wander from sea to sea, and from north to east; they shall run to and fro, seeking word of the Lord, but they shall not find it.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Amos 8:12); and <br /> Whereas, I John 4:7-8 says, &ldquo;Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God; everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. Whoever does not love does not know God, for God is love.&rdquo; (NRSV); and <br /> Whereas, This love that Jesus calls us to is not just for those who love us, but Jesus in Luke teaches, &ldquo;Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who abuse you. . . .Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.&rdquo; (Luke 6:27, 36 NRSV); and <br /> Whereas, I Corinthians 13:1-13 gives us a good starting place to understand what it means to live in love (agape).&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;...Faith, hope and love abide...And the greatest of these is love.&rdquo; (Verse 13 NRSV); and <br /> Whereas, Jesus says in John 15:11-12, &ldquo;I have said these things to you so that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be complete. This is my commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you.&rdquo;; and <br /> Whereas, Matthew 25:31-45 tells us that our love of Christ is manifested in how we respond to the deepest needs of the poor and powerless, those who are the most vulnerable, and most often affected by the social, economic, and political issues of the age.&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me.&rdquo;; and <br /> Whereas, The founder of our denomination, John Wesley, calls us to strive toward perfection, meaning striving toward becoming the most loving people we can become; <br /> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> That the church, as the presence of God in creation, is called to keep the Biblical witness alive to provide moral accountability to our society as we seek to be a witness to God&rsquo;s loving desires for all of God&rsquo;s children in our communities, nation and around the world. <br /> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>every church study I Corinthians 13:1-13 and the Biblical understandings of agape. <br /> </b><br /></p></td>
