The resident bishop of the respondent shall proceed to convene the court under the provisions of ¶ 2709. <br> 2. The resident bishop shall designate another bishop to be presiding officer. <br> 3.<i> a)</i> The trial for a clergy member or a local pastor shall be convened as provided in ¶&nbsp;2709 with the pool of thirty-five or more persons to consist of clergy in full connection. If there are not enough persons in appropriate categories in an annual conference to complete the pool, additional persons may be appointed from other annual conferences. All appointments to the pool shall be made by the district superintendents. Special consideration should be given so that the pool includes persons representative of racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b)</i> The trial for a diaconal minister shall be convened as<br> provided in ¶ 2709 and shall consist of a pool of thirty-five or more persons who shall be diaconal ministers or, when necessary, members of the Church. Special consideration should be given so that the pool includes persons representative of racial, ethnic, and gender diversity. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Counsel for the Church shall be a clergyperson in full connection. <br> 5. The secretary of the court shall at the conclusion of the proceedings send all trial documents to the secretary of the annual conference, who shall keep them in custody. Such documents are to be held in a confidential file and shall not be released for other than appeal or new trial purposes without a signed release from both the clergyperson charged and the presiding officer of the trial that tried the case. If an appeal is taken, the secretary shall forward the materials forthwith to the president of the court of appeals of the jurisdictional or central conference. If a president has not been elected, the secretary shall send the materials to such members of the court of appeals as the president of the College of Bishops shall designate. After the appeal has been heard, the records shall be returned to the secretary of the annual conference unless a further appeal on a question of law has been made to the Judicial Council, in which case the relevant documents shall be forwarded to the secretary of that body. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
