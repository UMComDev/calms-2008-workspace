It is a tragedy that wounds the heart of God. Thousands of <br /> lives have been lost, millions of Iraqis have fled their country, and hundreds of billions of <br /> dollars wasted in a war the United States initiated and never should have fought. <br /> A bipartisan U.S. commission appointed by President Bush chaired by former Governor <br /> Tom Keane and former Representative Lee Hamilton established that: <br /> </ul><li>No weapons of mass destruction were stored in Iraq; <br /> </ul><li>There was no attempt on the part of the government of Saddam Hussein to <br /> purchase uranium from the nation of Niger; <br /> </ul><li>There were no ties between Saddam Hussein and the events of September 11, <br /> 2001; <br /> </ul><li>There were no ties between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda. <br /> As people of Jesus Christ, the Prince of Peace, we pray for peace, stability and freedom <br /> in Iraq. We believe the Iraqi people can and should ultimately determine how these will <br /> be achieved. It is time for the United States to end the conflict and withdraw U.S. troops, <br /> to discontinue waging war and to seek a peaceful political solution in concert with the <br /> international community. <br /> In recognition of the Church&rsquo;s responsibility to work for peace, The General Conference <br /> of The United Methodist Church calls upon the U.S. government to: <br /> 1. End the cycle of violence in Iraq by developing and implementing a plan for the <br /> immediate and safe withdrawal of all U.S. troops from the country; <br /> 2. Work with Iraqis of good will, the United Nations and nations in the Middle East to <br /> bring about a peaceful, long-term resolution to the conflict and rebuild Iraq; <br /> 3. Commit U.S. funds for the rebuilding of Iraq through a plan that ensures the <br /> participation of the Iraqis and gives them hope for their future; <br /> 4. Provide adequate funding for U.S. military personnel returning from Iraq and their <br /> families. <br /> We urge United Methodists throughout the world to pray for an immediate end to the war <br /> in Iraq and to speak out for public policies that promote peace, justice and reconciliation. <br /> </b><br /></p></td>
