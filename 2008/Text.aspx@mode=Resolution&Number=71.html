African American Methodist Heritage Center <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, Black Methodists for Church Renewal, Inc. (BMCR), a caucus of The United Methodist Church, has engaged in a process to establish and provide for the maintenance of an African American Methodist Heritage Center, connected with a historically Black institution, that will preserve and protect artifacts and be accessible for research about African American people in Methodism; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, in spite of the best efforts of many, there is no single repository for the history, memories, and stories of those of African descent, who have been a part of Methodism since its inception in the mid 18</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;century and those of African descent who have stayed throughout Methodism&rsquo;s history; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, the depositing of these artifacts will be symbolic of the stones that Joshua directed to be taken from the River Jordan and placed as a monument so that generations to come will always remember the trials and triumphs of our journey (Joshua 4:19-24); and <br> Whereas, BMCR has been in consultation with the General Commission on Archives and History, and both entities have entered into an agreement wherein the General Commission on Archives and History will be the temporary repository until a permanent location can be found in a historic African American United Methodist institution; and <br> Whereas, the General Commission on Religion and Race strongly supports the work of the Heritage Center as a partner in the collection of historical documents related to the Central Jurisdiction and views the Heritage Center as, possibly, the future home of materials related to the General Commission on Religion and Race Central Jurisdiction Recovery Project. <br> &nbsp; <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the General Conference of The United Methodist Church meeting in 2004 commend BMCR and the General Commission on Archives and History for their cooperation in the development of such a project and applaud all those who will work to assure this great legacy of our common history. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that all United Methodists find ways and means to be supportive of this project with their prayers, their memorabilia, and their gifts to ensure the successful completion of this project. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Commission on Religion and Race be supportive of this initiative through its advocacy and consultative responsibilities. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the African American Methodist Heritage Center, Inc., initiated by BMCR, in consultation with the General Commission on Archives and History, establish an endowment fund through The United Methodist Church Foundation and seek authorization, if appropriate, to solicit gifts in this fund for the purpose of financial support of the African American Methodist Heritage Center and its growth. <br> </i></i><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See </i>Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
