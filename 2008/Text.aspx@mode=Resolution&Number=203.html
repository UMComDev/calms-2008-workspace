<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>GAMBLING <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>203. Gambling <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The Social Principles state that, &ldquo;Gambling is a menace to society, deadly to the best interests of moral, social, economic, and spiritual life, and destructive of good government. As an act of faith and concern, Christians should abstain from gambling and should strive to minister to those victimized by the practice. Where gambling has become addictive, the church will encourage such individuals to receive therapeutic assistance so that the individual&rsquo;s energies may be redirected into positive and constructive ends. The church should promote standards and personal lifestyles that would make unnecessary and undesirable the resort to commercial gambling-including public lotteries-as a recreation, as an escape, or as a means of producing public revenue or funds for support of charities or government&rdquo; (¶ 163G). <br> When asked which commandment is first of all, Jesus answered, &ldquo;Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is one; you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength&rdquo; (Mark 12:29-30). Gambling feeds on human greed and invites persons to place their trust in possessions rather than in God. It represents a form of idolatry that contradicts the first commandment. Jesus continued: &ldquo;The second is this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself&rsquo;&ldquo; (Mark 12:31). In relating with compassion to our sisters and brothers, we are called to resist those practices and systems that exploit them and leave them impoverished and demeaned. The apostle Paul wrote in 1 Timothy 6:9-10a: &ldquo;People who want to get rich fall into temptation and a trap and into many foolish and harmful desires that plunge men into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil.&rdquo;<br> Gambling, as a means of acquiring material gain by chance and at the neighbor&rsquo;s expense, is a menace to personal character and social morality. Gambling fosters greed and stimulates the fatalistic faith in chance. Organized and commercial gambling is a threat to business, breeds crime and poverty, and is destructive to the interests of good government. It encourages the belief that work is unimportant, that money can solve all our problems, and that greed is the norm for achievement. It serves as a &ldquo;regressive tax&rdquo; on those with lower income. In summary, gambling is bad economics; gambling is bad public policy; and gambling does not improve the quality of life. <br> We oppose the growing legalization and state promotion of gambling. <br> Dependence on gambling revenue has led many states to exploit the weakness of their own citizens, neglect the development of more equitable forms of taxation, and thereby further erode the citizens&rsquo; confidence in government. <br> We oppose the legalization of pari-mutuel betting, for it has been the opening wedge in the legalization of other forms of gambling within the states and has stimulated illegal bookmaking. We deplore the establishment of state lotteries and their use as a means of raising public revenues. The constant promotion and the wide advertising of lotteries have encouraged large numbers of persons to gamble for the first time. <br> We express an even more serious concern for the increasing development of the casino enterprise in the United States, for it has taken captive entire communities and has infiltrated many levels of government with its fiscal and political power. <br> Public apathy and a lack of awareness that petty gambling feeds organized crime have opened the door to the spread of numerous forms of legal and illegal gambling. <br> We support the strong enforcement of antigambling laws, the repeal of all laws that give gambling an acceptable and even advantageous place in our society, and the rehabilitation of compulsive gamblers. <br> The church has a key role in fostering responsible government and in developing health and moral maturity that free persons from dependence on damaging social customs. We urge national, tribal, state and local governments to read, analyze and implement the recommendations of the National Gambling Impact Study report released by the United States in 1999. It is expected that United Methodist churches abstain from the use of raffles, lotteries, bingo, door prizes, other drawing schemes, and games of chance for the purpose of gambling or fundraising. United Methodists should refrain from all forms of gambling practices carried on in our communities and should work to influence community organizations to develop forms of funding that do not depend upon gambling. <br> The General Board of Church and Society shall provide materials to local churches and annual conferences for study and action to combat gambling and to aid persons addicted to gambling. The,General Board of Church and Society, annual conferences, and local churches shall work with the National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling and grassroots organizations opposing gambling to stop and reverse legalized gambling. The General Board of Church and Society shall report to the 2008 General Conference which stock market and securities practices might be considered forms of gambling. The Board shall consult with the General Board of Pensions and Health Benefits and other agencies with investment portfolios in developing this report.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1980<br> AMENDED and READOPTED 1996<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 163<i>G.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
