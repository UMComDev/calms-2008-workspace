<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>BOYCOTTS <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>194. Boycott of USA TODAY <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b><i>Be it resolved that</i> the General Conference of The United Methodist Church reaffirm its witness for justice in the workplace by continuing to refrain from buying the <i>Detroit News</i> and <i>Detroit Free Press</i> until a just settlement of the newspaper dispute is achieved through collective bargaining. And further, by instituting an economic boycott against <i>USA TODAY</i>, the flagship publication of Gannett Co., Inc., to protest the lack of progress in settling the dispute and to press for early resolution. <br> This action is proposed in compliance with &ldquo;Guidelines for Instituting an Economic Boycott&rdquo; as prescribed in the <i>1996 Book of Resolutions</i>, pages 458-462. (<i>See also</i> pp. 507-511, 2004 edition.) <br> </i></i></ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Rationale <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>From its earliest history, The United Methodist Church has supported and engaged in activities that promote just working conditions. John Wesley&rsquo;s street ministry responded to the poor treatment of coal miners. He helped create laws against abusive child labor and the inhumane treatment of prisoner workers. Our Social Principles affirm the dignity of the worker and explicitly reject the permanent replacement of a worker who engages in a legal strike (¶ 163b). Federal law also prohibits the replacement of workers in an unfair labor practice strike. <br> <i>Biblical and theological statement: </i>The creation story of Genesis 1 asserts that human beings are made in God&rsquo;s image. Since in the Ancient Near East it had always been the king who represented the image of God, Israel&rsquo;s assertion was a radical statement of common human dignity, worth, and equality. That same Genesis account, by identifying God&rsquo;s labor and rest in creation, honors all human labor and establishes the justice and spiritual integrity of human rest. <br> In Exodus, when the brick makers of Egypt cry out to God, Moses is sent with authority to negotiate on their behalf with Pharaoh. With God&rsquo;s power, Moses then leads the most definitive and exemplary walkout to freedom in history. <br> When the prophets took measure of the nation&rsquo;s health, they always looked to the least-the widows and orphans and sojourners in the land, but also (as the law spells out-Lev. 19:13; Deut. 24:15) to the fate of workers. King Josiah was challenged by Jeremiah: &ldquo;Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, and his upper rooms by injustice; who makes his neighbors serve him for nothing, and does not give them their wages&rdquo; (22:13). And the book of James echoes that same spirit: &ldquo;Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, cry out; and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (5:4). <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>The Issue <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>On July 13, 1995, twenty-five hundred employees-members of<br> six unions of the Detroit News, the Detroit Free Press, and Detroit newspapers-engaged in a strike over an accumulated list of twelve unfair labor practices which the unions had charged against the newspapers. Three weeks later, workers were threatened with permanent replacement and subsequently were replaced. <br> The Gannett corporation has controlling interest in Detroit newspapers, an agency created to manage the joint operating agreement between the <i>Detroit News</i> and <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, and has failed to effect a negotiated settlement with its striking/locked-out employees over four long years. The newspapers have twice been found guilty of unfair labor practices. Twice they were ordered to bargain the contracts and return locked-out workers to their jobs; they have not complied. There is little evidence that serious attempts are being made by the newspapers to resolve outstanding issues. The papers have published incomplete and distorted information regarding the dispute. An economic boycott against <i>USA TODAY</i> will bring the strength<br> and power of our body of faith to the effort for resolution. It will demonstrate that people of faith take seriously their commitment to just treatment of employees and in their basic right to collective bargaining. <br> This dispute has created untold suffering for the workers involved. Because of the lack of reliable information, the dispute with the <i>Detroit News</i> and <i>Detroit Free Press</i> has caused devastating hardship for the greater community once served by these two newspapers. The <i>News </i>and<i> Free Press</i> have continued to publish, but hundreds of thousands of readers have canceled subscriptions; and many community, political, and religious leaders have acted out their call for justice by publicly refusing to buy or read the papers. Many progressive leaders refuse to be interviewed or to write opinion articles until a just settlement is reached. Such circumstance creates a serious lack of balanced and accurate news for all of the state. <br> In the four years since the strike began, numerous attempts have been made by union leaders and striking/locked-out workers to reopen negotiations. And from the beginning, community, political, and religious leaders have tried to help resolve the conflict and bring about a resolution. Offers to assist in mediating have been made by several religious leaders and public officials. <br> Religious Leaders for Justice at the Detroit newspapers (more than 850 religious leaders from the greater Detroit metropolitan area) joined other groups such as the Interfaith Committee for Worker Justice and Readers United in working toward a resolution. Twenty-six municipal bodies were represented at the May, 1998 summit meeting and also joined in the attempt. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), federal mediators, federal courts who have twice found the newspapers guilty of nine unfair labor practices, the UAW, and the International AFL-CIO, have all made efforts to resolve this divisive dispute. <br> Consider these events among many: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>October 1995-The unions proposed a 30-day period of intensive bargaining. At the end of 30 days, all unresolved issues would be submitted to a community panel to be chosen jointly by the unions and the company for binding arbitration. Detroit Newspapers rejected this offer.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> December 1995-U.S. Senator Carl Levin (Michigan), Cardinal Adam Maida of the Detroit Archdiocese and Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer met with newspaper officials and offered to help arbitrate the dispute. The unions accepted the offer, but the company rejected it. United Methodist Bishop Donald A. Ott of the Detroit Conference and Episcopal Bishop Stewart Wood of the Michigan Diocese also offered to mediate and were rejected. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> January 1996-Many denominations and faiths have definitive statements about the just treatment of workers. Early in 1996, more than 850 religious leaders from the greater Detroit metropolitan area (Religious Leaders for Justice at the Detroit Newspapers) presented an appeal asking the newspapers to negotiate contracts and settle the strike. They vowed not to buy the <i>Detroit News</i> and <i>Detroit Free Press </i>until the dispute was resolved, saying, &ldquo;We consider the permanent replacement of striking workers by the owners of both the <i>News</i> and <i>Free Press</i> to be morally objectionable and a breach of the ethical teachings of our faith traditions,&rdquo; and that, &ldquo; . . . workers have a moral right to form unions for the purpose of collective bargaining to achieve justice in the workplace. The permanent replacement of strikers negates that basic right.&rdquo; Hundreds of thousands of readers have joined this refusal to buy the papers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> March-May, 1996-Community and religious leaders, among them seven United Methodist pastors, undertook weekly symbolic and direct actions at the newspaper headquarters. These non-violent actions, organized by the independent community group, Readers United, resulted in nearly 300 arrests. United Methodist pastor Rev. Bill Wylie-Kellermann led weekly non-violence training of participants and peacekeepers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> May 1996-Representatives of Readers United met separately with the Metro Council of Newspaper Unions and with Detroit Newspapers executives Frank Vega and Heath Meriwether to discuss both non-violence and the urgency of a settlement. They also offered community mediation to resolve the struggle. The newspapers refused this offer. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> August 1996-Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer met with both sides and offered to give good-paying jobs to all the replacement workers so union members could reclaim their rightful places. The newspapers rejected the offer. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Spring of 1996, 1997 and 1998-Delegations of religious, political, community and union members attended each annual meeting of the Gannett and Knight-Ridder corporations, appealing for a good faith effort to settle the labor dispute. The meetings took place in Arlington, Va., Miami, Fla., Philadelphia, Pa., and San Jose, Calif. The CEOs and Directors of Gannett and Knight-Ridder rejected requests for private meetings from community leaders, U.S. Congressman John Conyers, Detroit City Council Chair Maryanne Mahaffey, and Reverend Edwin Rowe, pastor of Detroit Central UMC. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> February 1997-The unions ended their strike with an unconditional offer to return to work. Detroit newspapers accepted the offer, but refused to reinstate the workers. Employees were placed on a hiring list to be recalled as positions opened up. Over the course of two years, less than 700 union members have been called back, leaving more than 1,000 workers locked-out. The company has eliminated entire job categories, locking out dozens of employees with more than 30 years service. They have reduced wages by 50 percent for some positions, turned full-time jobs into part-time work and made massive changes in the terms of employment without regard for employee representation. Following these unilateral actions, the NLRB instituted new charges of unfair labor practices against the newspapers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> June 1997-After a yearlong trial, an administrative law judge found the Detroit newspapers guilty of 10 of 12 unfair labor practices. The judge ordered the company to take back all the locked-out workers immediately, releasing replacement workers if necessary. He also said the company must provide workers with back pay dating back to the day the return to work offer was made. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the company&rsquo;s unfair labor practices were: provoking and prolonging the strike, forcing an illegal merit pay system on the Newspaper Guild, refusal to provide the unions with information essential to the collective bargaining process, the illegal destruction of materials ripped down from union bulletin boards, the unlawful use of permanent replacement workers in an unfair labor practice strike. <br> The day after the judge&rsquo;s decision, 100,000 people marched through downtown Detroit as part of Action Motown, a mobilization called to support locked-out workers and urge the company to negotiate contracts. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Winter 1998-The National Labor Relations Board charged the newspapers with illegally firing 125 union members for exercising their civil and constitutional rights to strike and picket. Lawyers estimate that with company appeals, many of these cases may take up to five years to resolve. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> March-April, 1998-Religious and community leaders made presentations to more than two dozen city councils in and around Detroit. The municipalities issued resolutions agreeing to attend a community summet meeting to explore ways to urge the ending the labor dispute. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> May 1998-More than 300 people, including city council members and mayors from 26 cities in the Detroit area, participated in the Summit Meeting held at Sacred Heart Seminary in Detroit. Episcopal Bishop Start Wood of the Michigan Diocese presided over the meeting. Panelists Rabbi Robert Syme, United Methodist pastor Rev. Bill Wylie-Kellermann, Baptist Ministers Conference president Rev. J. J. Perry, Newspaper Guild President Lou Mleczko, former Free Press columnist Susan Watson, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Gumbleton and United Methodist Bishop Donald Ott, asked the participants how the labor dispute was affecting their communities. Many cited the absence of basic information so necessary in the democratic process. Hundreds of thousands of people refuse to buy or read the papers because they believe employees were treated unfairly. Public officials and progressive voices of the area refuse to be interviewed by the newspapers while the lockout continues. Such absences create unbalanced and incomplete news. Others cited the bad feelings and divisiveness created by the community&rsquo;s perception of being overcome by a media giant who operates from hundreds of miles away and appears to care little about Detroit&rsquo;s problems. Detroit newspaper officials were invited to participate in the summit but declined to send a representative. They agreed, however, to receive information gathered at the meeting. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> July 1998-A delegation led by United Methodist Bishop Jesse DeWitt representing elected officials, Religious Leaders for Justice, and the Inter-faith Committee for Worker Justice met with union leadership and Detroit newspaper management separately to report the conclusions of the Summit. Both the newspapers and the unions agreed to begin bargaining in good faith. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>August 1998-After more than three years of the strike/lockout, negotiations resumed under the supervision of the Federal Mediation Service. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> September 1998-After a year of deliberation, the National Labor Relations Board upheld the administrative law judge&rsquo;s decision that the company is guilty of provoking and prolonging the strike through nine unfair labor practices. The NLRB, comprised of both Republicans and Democrats, reached a unanimous decision. Once again, the company was ordered to take back all workers who were illegally replaced. The company still refused to abide by the order, instead asking the NLRB to reconsider its unanimous decision. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> February 1999-Sporadic negotiations continue, while both sides wait for the NLRB to announce its decision on the motion to reconsider its ruling. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During all this time of community distress, endless appeals and economic hardship for striking/locked-out workers, hundreds of prayer vigils, marches, rallies, picket lines, and demonstrations have taken place in support of a just settlement and protesting the permanent replacement of workers. All these efforts have failed to resolve this dispute. <br> Much has been made of the violence of the strike, yet observers are surprised at how restrained frustrated workers have been. Security guards, admittedly trained to instigate violence and then photograph reaction to it, have injured many workers who were legally picketing. No incidence of injury against replacement workers or managers has been documented. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Decision Making <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The act of instituting an economic boycott is a sobering one and is approached with all seriousness. We have thoughtfully considered the implications of a boycott in light of the disciplinary requirements in The Book of Resolutions. We believe an economic boycott of USA TODAY, the flagship publication of the Gannett corporation, is necessary to: achieve a just resolution before the suffering of the workers and the community becomes more acute; and, before the process of collective bargaining is further eroded. A fair resolution to this dispute will also have profound effects on newspaper employees in other cities who struggle for fair treatment and just wages. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Monitoring <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Upon approval by the Detroit Annual Conference, information regarding this issue will be dispersed through established agencies. The Gannett Company will be informed of the boycott and its intended purpose. A monitoring team with broad representation of clergy, lay, political, and business members will be established to keep our constituencies informed. The annual conference, districts, and pastors will be informed of the circumstances and reasons for the action. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Suspension/Termination Procedure <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The boycott will be terminated as soon as bargained contracts with the six unions are achieved. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See </i>Social Principles, ¶ 163<i>B. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
