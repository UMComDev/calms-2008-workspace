The senate shall be composed of twenty-five voting members who, at the time of election, are actively engaged in the work of education through employment in an educational institution and are fitted by training and experience for the technical work of evaluating educational institutions <b>or are members of an annual conference Board of Ordained Ministry, which is charged with credentialing clergy for service</b>. Election is for the quadrennium, except in cases where conflict of interest arises as a result of change in employment. Nine of these members shall be elected quadrennially by the National Association of Schools and Colleges of The United Methodist Church&mdash;seven of whom shall be chief executive officers of United Methodist-related educational institutions, the other two holding other positions relevant to academic or financial affairs or Church relationships<b>, or serving on or staffing an Annual Conference Board of Ordained Ministry</b>; four by the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry&mdash;two of whom shall be chief executive officers of United Methodist-related higher educational institutions, <strike> the other two </strike>&nbsp; <b>one </b>holding <strike> other</strike>&nbsp; <b>a </b>position<strike> s</strike>&nbsp;relevant to academic or financial affairs or Church relationships, <b>and one serving on or staffing an Annual Conference Board of Ordained Ministry</b>; four by the General Conference&mdash;two of whom shall be chief executive officers of United Methodist-related educational institutions at the time of their election, the other two holding other positions relevant to academic or financial affairs or Church relationships; <strike> four</strike>&nbsp; <b>two </b>by the senate itself, without limitation other than the general provisions of this paragraph; and <strike> four</strike>&nbsp; <b>six </b>shall be appointed by the Council of Bishops&mdash;two of whom shall be chief executive officers of United Methodist-related educational institutions, <strike> the other</strike>&nbsp;two holding other positions relevant to academic or financial affairs or Church relationships<b>, and two serving on or staffing Annual Conference Boards of Ordained Ministry</b>. Each of the five electing bodies shall elect at least one woman. <br />  Members elected by the General Conference shall be nominated and elected by the following procedure: Twelve persons shall be nominated by the Council of Bishops, six of whom shall be chief executive officers of United Methodist-related educational institutions, the other six holding other positions relevant to academic or financial affairs or Church relationships<b>, or serving on or staffing Annual Conference Boards of Ordained Ministry</b>. At the same daily session at which the above nominations are announced, additional nominations may be made from the floor but at no other time. From these nominations, the General Conference shall elect without discussion, by ballot and by plurality vote, the four persons to serve on the senate, two from each of the two categories of nominees. Should a vacancy occur in the members elected by General Conference in the interim prior to the next General Conference, the Council of Bishops shall appoint a replacement taken from the remaining nominees. The election process shall be repeated at each succeeding General Conference. Care should be taken that women, racial and ethnic persons, and representatives from the United Methodist-related Black colleges and graduate theological seminaries shall be members of the senate. If a member (other than the four elected by the General Conference) retires from educational work<b> or no longer serves on or staffs an Annual Conference Board of Ordained Ministry</b>, or for any other cause a vacancy occurs during the quadrennium, it shall be filled by the agency by which the retiring member was elected at its next meeting. The general secretary of the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry and the associate general secretaries of the Divisions of Higher Education and Ordained Ministry of that board shall serve as ex officio members of the senate, with voice but without vote. There shall be one staff representative on the senate from the General Board of Global Ministries, with voice but without vote, named by the general secretary of the General Board of Global Ministries.<br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Since the institutions reviewed and approved by the University Senate have direct impact upon Annual Conference Boards of Ordained Ministry and those appearing before them for credentialing, Boards of Ordained Ministry should have a voice in the determination of the institutions approved to educate those who will serve.<br /></p></td>
