The disclaimer must be of the entire benefit. The effect of such disclaimer is to treat the Spouse as if he or she had predeceased the Participant; or&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither the Participant&rsquo;s survivors nor the Administrator can locate the Spouse (provided, however, that the Administrator will have no obligation to search for such Spouse).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> If the Spouse is legally incompetent to give consent, the Spouse&rsquo;s legal guardian, even if such guardian is the Participant, may give consent. Such consent shall not be required if it is established to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the required consent cannot be obtained because there is no Spouse, the Spouse cannot be located, or due to other relevant facts and circumstances. A former Spouse&rsquo;s waiver shall not be binding on a current Spouse.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Amend Section 9.04c as follows: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Participant may designate multiple Beneficiaries who will divide any benefit payable under Section 5.03 in equal shares<b>, per capita, unless the Participant clearly specifies another division</b>. Any election made by a Participant and consented to by his<strike> /</strike>&nbsp; <b>or</b> her Spouse may be revoked by the Participant in writing without the consent of the Spouse, provided such revocation is filed by a form provided by the Administrator and filed with the Administrator during the Participant&rsquo;s lifetime. <br /> Amend Section 9.05c as follows: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Surviving Spouse may designate multiple Beneficiaries who will divide any benefit payable under Section 5.03g in equal shares<b>, per capita, unless the Surviving Spouse clearly specifies another division</b>. Any election made by a Surviving Spouse and consented to by his<strike> /</strike>&nbsp; <b>or</b> her Spouse may be revoked by the Surviving Spouse in writing without the consent of the Spouse, provided such revocation is filed by a form provided by the Administrator and filed with the Administrator during the Surviving Spouse&rsquo;s lifetime. <br /> Amend Section 11.04 by adding a new subsection f after subsection e that reads as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notwithstanding the terms of Section 11.04e, on an after January 1, 2009, any benefit payable under this Section 11.04 shall not cease if a Surviving Spouse remarries.
