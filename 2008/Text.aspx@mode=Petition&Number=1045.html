The number to be elected shall correspond to the number of members whose terms expire at the conclusion of such session. Each of the jurisdictions and the central conferences as a group shall be represented by at least one nominee, but it shall not be a requirement that each of the jurisdictions or the central conferences as a group be represented by an elected member. At the same daily session at which the above nominations are announced, nominations of both ministers and laypersons may be made from the floor, but at no other time. <b>At least twenty-four hours prior to the time of the election, there shall be a forum to which all the candidates shall be invited and asked to answer the same questions. This forum shall be at a time and place determined by the General Conference and is not required to take place during a session of the General Conference. </b>The names of all nominees, identified with the conference to which each belongs, and a biographical sketch that does not exceed one hundred words shall be published by the <i>Daily Christian Advocate</i> at least forty-eight hours prior to the time of election, which shall be set by action of the General Conference at the session at which the nominations are made; and from these nominations the General Conference shall elect without discussion, by ballot and majority vote, the necessary number of ministerial and lay members. <br /> <br /> This legislation becomes effective upon adoption. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>A brief biographical sketch provides the General Conference with insufficient information to make wise decisions about the best candidates. To make up for this lack of information, this is a lot of unofficial campaigning. A forum would provide uniform, accurate information about the candidates for all delegates.<br /></p></td>
