<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>4. Steps Toward a Dioxin-Free Future <br> </b><i>Theological Foundation <br> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>According to the Social Principles, &ldquo;All Creation is the Lord&rsquo;s and we are responsible for the ways in which we use and abuse it&rdquo; (¶ 160).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <CENTER><i>Background <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>1996 General Conference Resolution-&ldquo;A Dioxin-Free Future&rdquo;: The 1996 General Conference of The United Methodist Church passed a resolution called &ldquo;A Dioxin-Free Future,&rdquo; based on facts from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&rsquo;s 1994 Draft Dioxin Reassessment, which affirmed health warnings made 20 years ago-that the background levels of dioxin, a deadly chlorine-based chemical not found in nature, pose a serious threat to the health of the general U.S. population. (For specific health threats, please refer to the text of the resolution.) <br> The resolution supports a phase-out of the production of dioxin, beginning with immediate action on the three largest sources of dioxin: incineration of chlorine-containing wastes, bleaching of pulp and paper with chlorine, and the entire life cycle of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastic. <br> It also directs the General Board of Church and Society to cooperate with the Health and Welfare Ministries unit of the General Board of Global Ministries to work with companies, governments, and medical institutions to implement the above recommendations. <br> Medical waste incineration is a major source of dioxin contamination; this conclusion was raised by the same 1994 EPA Dioxin Reassessment report mentioned above. <br> Dioxins are created by the disposal of synthetic chlorinated organic compounds. Though the factors which determine dioxin formation during incineration are not fully understood, they are released into the environment during combustion of chlorinated plastic products, predominantly polyvinyl chloride (PVC). <br> The use of PVC products by the health care industry began after World War II and has grown rapidly, especially the single use or short term use applications (i.e. &ldquo;disposables&rdquo;). These account for most of the organically bound chlorine in medical waste. <br> The American Public Health Association&rsquo;s (APHA) warnings: The APHA in Resolution #9304 recognizes that &ldquo;virtually all chlorinated organic compounds that have been studied exhibit at least one of a wide range of serious toxic effects such as endocrine dysfunction, developmental impairment, birth defects, reproductive dysfunction and infertility, immunosuppression and cancer, often at very low doses.&rdquo;<br> &ldquo;First Do No Harm&rdquo; is a binding principle in medical ethics. <br> Some alternatives are available or in development: Appropriate alternative products composed of nonchlorinated material are currently available for many, though not all, health care uses of chlorinated plastics. Highly effective programs for the reduction of hospital waste have been initiated in the U.S. and programs for the substitution of other materials for PVC are in place in some hospitals in Europe. <br> <CENTER><i>Be it resolved that the General Conference of<br> The United Methodist Church: <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>1. Challenges all United Methodist-related health care institutions, United Methodist health care professionals and workers, and United Methodist individuals and congregations to begin immediately to take action to change health care policies and practices in order<br> to stop the harm being caused by the nonessential incineration of medical waste and by generating a waste stream that is more toxic than necessary. <br> 2. Urges all health care facilities to explore ways to reduce or eliminate their use of PVC plastics. <br> 3. Calls upon all health care professionals and workers to encourage health care institutions with which they are associated to adopt policies that will lead to the reduction and elimination of the use of PVC plastics. <br> 4. Suggests that health care facilities hire or assign professional staff to evaluate the potential for persistent toxic pollution associated with the life-cycle of products the facility purchases. <br> 5. Strongly urges medical suppliers to develop, produce and bring to market appropriate, cost-competitive products that can replace those that contain PVC or other chlorinated plastics. Any substitution for a chlorinated plastic product must provide a less toxic alternative with concern for the full public health implications of the replacement, including infectious considerations. <br> 6. Encourages government oversight agencies and private accrediting bodies to incorporate requirements for education about the reduction of toxic pollution in their certification standards. <br> 7. Encourages study and evaluation of alternative products and practices that will lead to the reduction and elimination of the use of PVC products; also encourages programs to provide technical assistance and training to health care facilities that seek help in the reduction of their reliance on chlorinated plastics. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p>&nbsp; </b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 160<i>A</i>.
