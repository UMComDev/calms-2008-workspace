But when Jesus saw this, he was indignant and said to them, &lsquo;Let the little children come to me; do not stop them; for it is to such as these that the Kingdom of God belongs. Truly I tell you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it.&rsquo; And he took them up in his arms, laid his hands on them, and blessed them.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Policy Base: The United Methodist Social Principles, 162.J (Alcohol and Other Drugs), 162.T (Right to Health Care) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, as demonstrated in the Social Principles, The United Methodist Church affirms: <br /> &ldquo;...wise policies relating to the availability of potentially beneficial or potentially&nbsp;&nbsp;damaging prescription and over-the-counter drugs; we urge that complete information about their use and misuse be readily available to both doctor and patient.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, Thimerosal (synonyms include: Thiomseral, Merthiolate, Thimerasol) is a severely toxic, antiquated, organic mercury compound (approximately 50% mercury by weight) that has been added to some vaccines and pharmaceutical products since the 1930s, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, numerous peer-reviewed scientific/medical studies published over many decades, at least since the 1930s, have recommended removing or restricting the use of Thimerasol in medicinal products, and have demonstrated its significant toxicity, <br /> Whereas, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended, in 1982, that Thimerosal be banned from topical over-the-counter products, and the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and United States Public Health Service called for its removal from all vaccines in July of 1999, as did the Institute of Medicine of the United States National Academy of Sciences in 2001, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, Thimerasol (mercury) still remains in some vaccines (including childhood vaccines and the flu shot), and many other pharmaceutical products in the US, and the mercury content of vaccines manufactured for use in developing nations has not been reduced, and in both cases, remains well in excess of Federal Safety Guidelines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, the Environmental Protection Agency of the State of California officially declared that Thimerasol is a developmental toxin, meaning that it can cause birth defects, low birth weight, biological dysfunctions, or psychological or behavior deficits that become manifest as the child grows, and that maternal exposure during pregnancy can disrupt the development or even cause the death of the fetus (The State of California has banned administration of Thimerasol-containing vaccines to children and pregnant women), <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, the public is given limited opportunity of informed consent in regard to these known risks of mercury exposure incurred through mandated injections and from many other pharmaceutical products, both prescription and over-the-counter, including topical antiseptic solutions and antiseptic ointments for treating cuts, nasal sprays, eye solutions, vaginal spermicides, diaper rash treatments, and perhaps most importantly, as a preservative in vaccines and other injectable biological products, including immune globulin preparations. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, vaccines are promoted for the prevention of diseases, it is also important to guard against any unintentional harm through their administration. It is a violation of human life to inject poison into any being, especially a pregnant woman or a newborn baby, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, there are some presently marked vaccines and pharmaceutical products that use safe, effective, and economical methods to eliminate the need for Thimerosal (mercury) preservatives, thereby increasing the safety of vaccines, <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore, be it resolved that The United Methodist Church support all efforts to protect the public, especially children, from mercury-containing drugs by calling on the World <br /> Health Organization, international and national health officials/agencies, including the US Secretary of Health and Human Services, the US Food and Drug Administration and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Immediately prioritize mercury-free stocks of vaccines and other pharmaceutical products for pregnant women, newborn infants and children, <br /> Provide &ldquo;the opportunity of informed consent&rdquo; and promote product education to individuals about mercury exposure through their pharmaceutical products or vaccines, detailing the known risks of toxicity and Federal Safety Guidelines for exposure to mercury; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Ban the presence of any mercury compound in pharmaceutical products or vaccines, prescribed or over-the-counter.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />  And be it further resolved, that, until mercury is banned from medicine, the medical missions, hospitals, clinics and ministries of The United Methodist Church strongly encourage mercury-free vaccines over mercury-containing ones. Acknowledging the difficulties in some contexts, we strongly urge that other organizations who are responsible for immunization efforts to prevent disease such as the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations, United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF), Rotary International, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as well as any other organization from which vaccines are purchased join the United Methodist Church in the education of and advocating for mercury free drugs and vaccines.</b><br /></b></b></p></td>
