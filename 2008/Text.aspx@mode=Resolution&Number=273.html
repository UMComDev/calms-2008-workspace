<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>273. Justice for Filipino WWII Veterans <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Filipinos who fought in the Armed Forces of the United States during World War II were American soldiers. On July 26, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordered the Army of the Philippine Commonwealth to serve under the American flag and under the command of General Douglas MacArthur. One hundred and forty two thousand Filipino soldiers fought courageously, served faithfully, suffered inhumane treatment and received the wrath of Japanese Imperial Army captors. These Filipino soldiers fought alongside soldiers from the United States in the battles of Bataan and Corregidor and were forced to take part in the Bataan Death March. They delayed and disrupted Japan&rsquo;s effort to conquer the Western Pacific and bought time for the United States to prepare the military to defeat Japan. <br> President Harry Truman promised veterans&rsquo; benefits to the Filipinos who had fought in the United States Armed Forces. However, on February 18, 1946, the United States Congress passed the Rescission Act which denied Filipino WWII veterans any benefits unless they had died in service or had been seriously wounded. Thus, Filipino WWII veterans were singled out not to receive benefits which were given to the French, Canadian and other allied nationals who, like the Filipinos, had served under the U.S. flag. Although President Roosevelt promised American citizenship to the Filipino soldiers who fought in the United States Armed Forces, it was not until 1990 that the U.S. Congress passed a law to allow them to become U.S. citizens. <br> Today, there are 72,000 surviving Filipino WWII veterans in their 70s and 80s who are still waiting for justice after more than fifty years. Many in the United States live in poverty. Often, four to six veterans share a studio apartment or live in a converted garage without heat during winter. They must continue to work in order to survive, because they don&rsquo;t get veterans&rsquo; benefits. Although some Filipino WWII veterans living in the U.S. eventually qualify for SSI, those living in the Philippines do not receive any benefits of any kind. A number of Filipino WWII veterans, both living in the United States and in the Philippines, are active members of United Methodist churches. The Filipino WWII veterans are fighting the last battle of their lives, to receive justice and veterans benefits in their lifetime. <br> The Bible says, &ldquo;You shall not wrong or oppress a resident alien, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt&rdquo; (Exodus 22:21) and &ldquo;You shall not deprive a resident alien or an orphan of justice&rdquo; (Deuteronomy 24:17). The Social Principles state, &ldquo;To begin to alleviate poverty, we support such policies as: adequate income maintenance, quality education, decent housing, job training, meaningful employment opportunities, adequate medical and hospital care, . . .&rdquo; (¶ 163<i>E</i>) which includes, veterans&rsquo; benefits for those who are entitled to them because of past service to the United States. <br> Every American deserves to know the important contribution of the Filipino veterans to the outcome of WWII. It is demeaning to Americans as well as to the Filipinos, for the United States to continue denying full benefits pledged by the President of the United States to Filipino WWII veterans. These benefits are not a gift or a favor, they were earned on the battlefield defending the United States. <br> The United Methodist Church and its members therefore resolve to support the Filipino WWII veterans in their fight for justice and equal benefits, and individual members and churches are urged to: (1) write to their senators and representatives urging them to co-sponsor legislation giving full benefits for Filipino WWII veterans; (2) write the President of the United States at The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20500, urging him to include a budget line item in the budget to fund full veterans benefits for Filipino WWII veterans; (3) contact Filipino WWII veteran-support groups to see how local churches can help indigent veterans who are so sick that they can no longer work to support themselves; and (4) invite Filipino WWII veterans to come and speak of their experiences to groups such as United Methodist Women, United Methodist Men, United Methodist Youth Fellowship, and the United Methodist Young Adult Fellowship. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 164<i>F</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
