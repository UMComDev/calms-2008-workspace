<br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the Pacific Islanders, religious and cultural heritage come together in the form of the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;The ethnic and cultural values of Pacific Islanders are affirmed and solidified in the way of Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pacific Island Christians truly believe that their identity, culture, and religious heritage, indeed, their way of life, is good and is where God is present and is at work.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, Pacific Islanders build churches wherever they settle.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Church becomes an affirmation of God&rsquo;s presence in their journey.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the Church in their new surroundings becomes the kin group or the village that they have left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;The multiple significance and value of the Church to the Pacific Islanders ensures its existence in places where Pacific Islanders settle.&nbsp;&nbsp;As they go forth into new territories, they have practiced their way of living.&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of that way of life is being the Church. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Samoan congregation was established as a Methodist Church in Honolulu, HI on February 13, 1963.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Tongan United Methodist fellowship was organized at Honolulu First United Methodist Church in Hawaii at a watch night service in 1970.&nbsp;&nbsp;On September 18, 1978, the first Tongan United Methodist Church was chartered in Salt Lake City, Utah.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the 1970s, an agreement was made between The United Methodist Church Council of Bishops and the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga whereby the Free Wesleyan Church of Tonga would not establish churches in the United States but that support would be given to the establishment of Tongan United Methodist Churches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Methodist members from the Fiji islands have also established ministries within several western states.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first United Methodist Church in Guam was chartered in Barrigada in 1980.&nbsp;&nbsp;The first church in Saipan was established in 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both of these churches are within the bounds of the Western Jurisdiction (California-Pacific Annual Conference). <br /> The 2005 U.S. census has identified 850,000 Pacific Islanders across forty-six states.&nbsp;&nbsp;This shows a significant potential for disciple making of Pacific Islanders across the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently there are approximately 63 Pacific Island United Methodist churches, fellowships, and ministries across the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mandate <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Pacific Islander&rsquo;s National Caucus of The United Methodist Church (PINCUM) hereby petitions the General Conference to establish the Pacific Islands United Methodist Church Ministry Study.&nbsp;&nbsp;The study will (1) research and study the needs in Pacific Island communities; (2) develop recommendations to address these needs; and (3) establish priorities on the funding of programs that would begin to develop ministries in the communities that would reach Pacific Islanders Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;These findings would be presented as recommendations to the 2012 General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <b>Implementation <br /> </b>In order to implement the Pacific Island United Methodist Church Ministry Study, a committee will be established.&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee will be composed of the following persons/categories: <br /> 10 Pacific Islanders sub-ethnic caucus members (selected by the caucuses) <br /> 1 Staff (related to racial/ethnic ministries) from each of the general agencies of the UMC <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 GBGM Staff of the Asian American and Pacific Islanders Ministries <br /> 1 Staff from the PINCUM <br /> Other persons as needed (to be determined by the committee) <br /> The committee will meet twice annually to design and administer an effective research tool for the gathering and analysis of information from Pacific Island communities throughout the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of this task, regional meetings throughout the United States (Hawaii, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Pacific Northwest, Salt Lake, Dallas, Florida, Midwest, Northeast) will be instituted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administrative oversight of the study be assigned to the General Board of Global Ministries Office of Asian American and Pacific Islander Ministries.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Proposed Budget &ndash; 2008-2012 <br /> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is recommended that a budget of $400,000 be approved to carry out the tasks of the Study.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10 Regional Meetings/Hearings&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
