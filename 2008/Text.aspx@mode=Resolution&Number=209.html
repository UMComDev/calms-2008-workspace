<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>209. Seek Pardon for Latin American Debt <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the end of the century finds us thrusting forward in the creation of a so-called &ldquo;world order&rdquo; that is exclusionary of great populations of the Third World, the same ones that will end up being even poorer as other people in developed countries are becoming richer; and <br> Whereas, in Latin America, with 468 million people, in spite of the efforts of their governments to diminish poverty, the number of poor people continues to grow; and <br> Whereas, the global village, called to be a village of solidarity, has demonstrated very few signs of that kind of fellowship, an exception being the positive example of the European governments that are willing to forgive the external debt of the countries affected by hurricanes George and Mitch; and <br> Whereas, the &ldquo;external&rdquo; debt of Latin American countries has become an &ldquo;eternal&rdquo; debt and a modern form of slavery, given the fact that the payment of just the interest on this debt is made in detriment of human life itself; and <br> Whereas, Christian people are called by Christ to realize the Reign of God, which is a reign of life, justice and love of God and neighbor, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church condemn this travesty of justice against human life and dignity and that it commit itself to support the Council of Evangelical Methodist Churches in Latin America and the Caribbean (CIEMAL) and Methodists Associated to Represent the Cause of Hispanic Americans (MARCHA) in our request that this external debt of Latin American countries, especially those affected by the hurricanes George and Mitch be pardoned, <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the 2000 General Conference petition this pardoning from the President of the United States of American and instruct all our churches, particularly the Hispanic/Latin churches, to write their representatives and senators in Washington, D.C. about this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>D </i>and<i> E. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
