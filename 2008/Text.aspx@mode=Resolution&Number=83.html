<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>83. Drug and Alcohol Concerns <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>As God&rsquo;s children and participants in the gift of abundant life, we recognize the need to respond to those who know brokenness from the widespread abuse of alcohol and other drugs in our world. The experience of God&rsquo;s saving grace offers wholeness to each individual. In light of the reality of alcohol and other drug abuse, the church has a responsibility to recognize brokenness and to be an instrument of education, healing, and restoration. First, we must be committed to confronting the denial within ourselves that keeps individuals and nations from overcoming their struggle with alcohol and other drug abuse. Second, the alcohol and other drug problem must be understood as a social, economic, spiritual, and health problem. Third, the church has a fundamental role in reorienting the public debate on alcohol and other drugs by shifting the focus from punishment to prevention and treatment. This is rooted in the Christian belief in the ongoing possibilities for transformation in the life of each individual and in our world. <br> The alcohol and other drug crisis has reached global proportions. More alcohol and other drugs are produced and consumed than ever before. In consuming countries, with their attendant problems of poverty, racism, domestic violence, hopelessness, and material despair, alcohol and other drug abuse is a part of a continuing cycle of economic and spiritual turmoil. <br> Abuse of legal drugs (alcohol, tobacco, and pharmaceuticals) remains a leading cause of disease and death around the world. While recreational use of illegal drugs in the United States has declined, the use of drugs remains socially acceptable as levels of addiction and abuse continue to rise. <br> Growing numbers of cities, small towns, and rural areas around the world are caught in a web of escalating alcohol and other drug-related violence. As the findings of the regional hearings in the United States stressed: &ldquo;Drug addiction crosses all ethnic, cultural, and economic backgrounds.&rdquo; Social systems are dangerously strained under the heavy weight of alcohol and other drug-related health and social problems. Meanwhile, the supply of drugs from developing countries continues to grow in response to high demand from the developed countries. <br> The United States policy response to the drug crisis has focused almost exclusively on law enforcement and military solutions. This policy, in some cases, has led to the erosion of precious civil liberties and human rights, especially for poor and minority communities. <br> International strategies should reflect the need for balanced, equitable economic growth and stable democratic governments in drug-producing developing countries. Most importantly, any alternative strategy must be rooted in local communities. The most creative and effective approaches to the present crisis begin at the local level. <br> The United Methodist Church has long opposed abuse of alcohol and other drugs. In 1916, the General Conference authorized the formation of a Board of Temperance, Prohibition, and Public Morals &ldquo;to make more effectual the efforts of the church to create public sentiment and crystallize the same into successful opposition to the organized traffic in intoxicating liquors.&rdquo;<br> During the 1988-92 quadrennium, The United Methodist Church launched a comprehensive Bishops&rsquo; Initiative on Drugs and Drug Violence, which, through regional hearings across the United States, deepened the denomination&rsquo;s awareness of alcohol and other drug problems. The report of these hearings concluded: &ldquo;Therefore, The United Methodist Church must play a key role in confronting drug and alcohol addiction. . . .&rdquo; Today, The United Methodist Church remains committed to curbing drug traffic and the abuse of alcohol and other drugs. <br> In response to the alcohol and other drug crisis, The United Methodist Church commits itself to a holistic approach, which emphasizes prevention, intervention, treatment, community organization, public advocacy, and abstinence. Out of love for God and our neighbors, the church must have a positive role by offering a renewed spiritual perspective on this crisis. We commend local congregations, annual conferences, and general agencies and seminaries to take action in the areas of alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs. <br> <CENTER><i>I. Alcohol <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Alcohol is a drug, which presents special problems because of its widespread social acceptance. We affirm our long-standing conviction and recommendation that abstinence from alcoholic beverages is a faithful witness to God&rsquo;s liberating and redeeming love. <br> This witness is especially relevant because excessive, harmful, and dangerous drinking patterns are uncritically accepted and practiced. Society glamorizes drinking, and youthful immaturity can be exploited for personal gain. The costs associated with alcohol use/abuse are more than the costs associated with all illegal drugs combined. Worldwide, millions of individuals and their families suffer as a result of alcoholism. The medical consequences of alcohol abuse include fetal alcohol syndrome--which is a preventable cause of mental retardation--cardiac defects, and pre- and postnatal growth retardation. Chronic alcohol consumption can have a damaging effect on every body organ, including brain, liver, heart, stomach, intestines, and mouth. Alcohol is a factor in many other social problems such as crime, poverty, and family disorder. The societal costs of alcohol abuse include lost productivity, increased health-care costs, loss of lives in vehicular accidents, and criminal activity. <br> Thus, The United Methodist Church bases its recommendation of abstinence on critical appraisal of the personal and societal costs in the use of alcohol. The church recognizes the freedom of the Christian to make responsible decisions and calls upon each member to consider seriously and prayerfully the witness of abstinence as part of his or her Christian commitment. Persons who practice abstinence should avoid attitudes of self-righteousness that express moral superiority and condemnatory attitudes toward those who do not choose to abstain. Because Christian love in human relationships is primary, abstinence is an instrument of love and sacrifice and always subject to the requirements of love. <br> Our love for our neighbor obligates us to seek healing, justice, and the alleviation of the social conditions that create and perpetuate alcohol abuse.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Therefore:</i><br> 1. We urge individuals and local congregations to demonstrate active concern for alcohol abusers and their families. We encourage churches to support the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of problem drinkers. <br> 2. We urge churches to include the problems of alcohol and the value of abstinence as a part of Christian education. <br> 3. We encourage individuals and local congregations to develop prevention education for family, church, and community. We encourage sound empirical research on the social effects of alcohol. <br> 4. We oppose the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages within the confines of United Methodist Church facilities and recommend that it be prohibited. <br> 5. We ask individuals and local congregations to study and discuss the problem of driving while intoxicated and impaired by alcohol or other drugs, and we support legislation to reduce such activity. <br> 6. We direct the General Board of Discipleship and The United Methodist Publishing House to incorporate educational material on alcohol and other drug problems, including the material on prevention, intervention, treatment, and the value of abstinence throughout its graded literature. <br> 7. We expect United Methodist-related hospitals to treat the alcoholic person with the attention and consideration all patients deserve. We urge the worldwide health-care delivery system to follow this example. <br> 8. We urge all legislative bodies and health-care systems and processes to focus on and implement measures to help meet the special needs of those disproportionately affected by alcohol use. <br> 9. We favor laws to eliminate all advertising and promoting of alcoholic beverages. We urge the General Board of Church and Society and local churches to increase efforts to remove all advertising of alcoholic beverages from the media. We urge special attention to curbing promotions of alcoholic beverages on college campuses as well as racial minority communities. <br> 10. We urge the Federal Trade Commission to continue developing better health hazard warning statements concerning the use of alcohol. <br> 11. We ask the United States government to improve interagency coordination of drug and alcohol abuse efforts so that there are uniform policies and regulations, and we look forward to the cooperation of all governments in these areas. <br> <CENTER><i>II. Tobacco <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The use of tobacco is another form of drug abuse, even though it is legal. Overwhelming evidence links cigarette-smoking with lung cancer, cardiovascular diseases, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis. In addition, cigarette-smoking can negatively affect a developing fetus, and secondary smoke is a known carcinogen. The United Methodist Church discourages all persons, particularly children, youths and young adults, from using any form of tobacco. <br> We commend the suspension of cigarette advertising on radio and television. We are concerned about other advertisements that associate smoking with physical and social maturity, attractiveness, and success, especially those targeted at youth, racial minorities, and women. We support the Federal Trade Commission&rsquo;s rules requiring health warning statements in cigarette packaging. We are also concerned that the tobacco industry is marketing tobacco in developing countries. <i>Therefore:</i><br> 1. We recommend that tobacco use be banned in all church facilities. <br> 2. We recommend a tobacco-free environment in all public areas. <br> 3. We recommend the prohibition of all commercial advertising of tobacco products. <br> 4. We support expanded research to discover the specific mechanisms of addiction to nicotine. We urge the development of educational methods that effectively discourage the use of tobacco and methods to assist those who wish to stop using tobacco. <br> 5. We urge the Department of Agriculture and other government agencies to plan for and assist the orderly economic transition of the tobacco industry-tobacco growers, processors, and distributors-into industries more compatible with the general welfare of the people. <br> 6. We support National Comprehensive Tobacco Control Legislation that includes provisions to: a) reduce the rate of youth smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes; b) protect tobacco farmers by helping them shift from tobacco to other crops; c) give the FDA full authority to regulate nicotine as a drug; d) fund anti-tobacco research and advertising, as well as education and prevention campaigns. <br> <CENTER><i>III. Drugs <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The United Methodist Church recognizes the widespread use and misuse of drugs that alter mood, perception, consciousness, and behavior of persons among all ages, classes, and segments of our society. Pharmacologically, a drug is any substance that by its chemical nature alters the structure or function of any living organism. This broad definition encompasses a wide range of substances, many of which are psychoactive and have the potential for abuse. These include marijuana, narcotics, sedatives and stimulants, psychedelics, and hallucinogens. Additionally, commonly used products such as glue, paint thinners, and gasoline have the potential to be abused as inhalants. <br> <i>A. Marijuana <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>Like alcohol and tobacco, marijuana is frequently a precursor to the use of other drugs. The active ingredient is THC, which affects the user by temporarily producing feelings of euphoria or relaxation. An altered sense of body image and bouts of exaggerated laughter are commonly reported. However, studies reveal that marijuana impairs short-term memory, altering sense of time and reducing the ability to perform tasks requiring concentration, swift reactions, and coordination. Some countries permit the use of marijuana in medicines.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, some states in the United States have passed legislation permitting the medical use of marijuana. The medical use of any drug should not be seen as encouraging recreational use of the drug. We urge all persons to abstain from all use of marijuana, unless it has been legally prescribed&nbsp;&nbsp;in a form appropriate for treating a particular medical condition.</sub><sup>1</sup></sub><br> <i>B. Sedatives and Stimulants <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>Sedatives, which include barbiturates and tranquilizers, are<br> prescribed appropriately for treatment of anxiety. These legally<br> prescribed drugs need to be taken only under appropriate medical supervision. The use of this class of drugs can result in dependence. <br> Severe physical dependence on barbiturates can develop at doses higher than therapeutic doses, and withdrawal is severe and dangerous. The combination of alcohol and barbiturates is potentially lethal. <br> Stimulants range from amphetamines to mild stimulants such as caffeine and nicotine. Prescribed for obesity, sleep disorders, hyperactivity, fatigue, and depression, stimulants produce a temporary sense of vitality, alertness, and energy. <br> Unlike other stimulants, cocaine has limited medical uses. When the powder form is inhaled, cocaine is a highly addictive central nervous system stimulant that heightens the body&rsquo;s natural response to pleasure and creates a euphoric high, and has the potential to be extremely lethal. &ldquo;Crack,&rdquo; a crystallized form of cocaine, is readily available because of its lesser cost. Addiction often comes from one use of the substance. <br> <i>C. Psychedelics or Hallucinogens <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>Psychedelics or hallucinogens, which include LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, PCP, and DMT, produce changes in perception and altered states of consciousness. Not only is there limited medical use, the use of these drugs may result in permanent psychiatric problems. <br> &nbsp; 1. Performance Resource Press, Inc., Troy, Michigan. <br> <i>D. Narcotics <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>Narcotics are prescribed for the relief of pain, but the risk of physical and psychological dependencies is well documented. Derived from the opium plant, natural narcotics include heroin, morphine, codeine, and percodan, while synthetic narcotics include methadone and meperidine. <br> <i>Therefore,</i> as The United Methodist Church: <br> 1. We oppose the use of all drugs, except in cases of appropriate medical supervision. <br> 2. We encourage the church to develop honest, objective, and factual drug education for children, youths, and adults as part of a comprehensive prevention education program. <br> 3. We urge the church to coordinate its efforts with ecumenical, interfaith, and community groups in prevention, rehabilitation, and policy statements. <br> 4. We encourage the annual conferences to recognize the unique impact of drugs and its related violence upon urban and rural areas and provide appropriate ministries and resources. <br> 5. We strongly encourage annual conferences to develop leadership training opportunities and resources for local church pastors and laity to help them with counseling individuals and families who have alcohol and other drug-related problems; counseling those bereaved by alcohol and other drug-related deaths and violence; and teaching stress management to church workers in communities with high alcohol and other drug activity. <br> 6. We support National Comprehensive Tobacco Control Legisla-tion that includes provisions to: a) reduce the rate of youth smoking by increasing the price of cigarettes; b) protect tobacco farmers by helping them shift from tobacco to other crops; c) give the FDA full authority to regulate nicotine as a drug; d) fund anti-tobacco research and advertising, as well as education and prevention campaigns. <br> 7. We urge redevelopment of more effective methods of treatment of drug abuse and addiction. <br> 8. We support government policies concerning drugs that are compatible with our Christian beliefs about the potential transformation of all individuals. <br> 9. We urge all United Methodist churches&nbsp;&nbsp;to work for a minimum legal drinking age of twenty-one years in their respective states/<br> nations. <br> 10. We support strong, humane law-enforcement efforts against the illegal sale of all drugs, and we urge that those arrested for possession and use of illegally procured drugs be subject to education and rehabilitation. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> AMENDED AND ADOPTED 2000<br> amended and readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 162<i>J</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
