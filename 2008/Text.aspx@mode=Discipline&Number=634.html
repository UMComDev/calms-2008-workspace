The duties of the annual conference board of ordained ministry shall be: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> To assume the primary responsibility for the enlistment and recruitment of ordained clergy by working in consultation with the cabinet and the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry to study and interpret the clergy needs and resources of the annual conference, with due regard to the inclusive nature of the Church. It shall, with the assistance of the local church committee on pastor-parish relations, conference agencies, and every ordained minister of the conference, enlist women and men of all races and ethnic origins for the ordained ministry and guide those persons in the process of education, training, and ordination, recommending colleges and schools of theology listed by the University Senate. Persons recruited should have an understanding of and appreciation for persons of different racial and ethnic heritages. <br> <i>b)</i> To seek from a school of theology information about the personal and professional qualities of an applicant for probationary membership or of a probationary member; <i>provided,</i> however, that the applicant or member consent to the provision of such information. <br> <i>c)</i> To receive annual reports on the progress made by each ministerial student enrolled in a theological school and to record credit for work satisfactorily completed. <br> <i>d)</i> It shall require a transcript of credits from each applicant before recognizing any of the applicant&rsquo;s educational claims. In case of doubt, the board may submit a transcript to the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry for evaluation. <br> <i>e)</i> The board shall annually appoint and train a sufficient number of mentors in each district in consultation with the district superintendent. <br> <i>f)</i> To guide the candidate for ordained ministry who is not enrolled in a theological school and who is pursuing the Course of Study as adopted by the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry. <br> <i>g)</i> To examine all applicants as to their fitness for the ordained ministry and make full inquiry as to the fitness of the candidate for: (1) annual election as local pastor; (2) election to probationary membership; and (3) election to full conference membership. <br> <i>h) </i>To provide all candidates for ordained ministry a written statement on the disciplinary and annual conference requirements for the local pastor, probationary, and full membership. <br> <i>i)</i> To interview and report recommendation concerning: (1) student local pastors; (2) certified candidates for ordination as deacons; and (3) certified candidates for ordination as elders.</sub><sup>80 <br> </sup></sub><i>j)</i> To assign a board member to serve as liaison to retired clergy in the conference. <br> <i>k)</i> To interview applicants and make recommendation concerning: (1) changes from the effective relation to a leave of absence<br> or retirement; (2) return to the effective relation from other relations; (3) honorable location; (4) readmission of located persons and persons discontinued from probationary membership; (5) sabbatical leave; (6) incapacity leave; (7) appointment as a student; (8) termination; and (9) changes to or from less than full-time ministry. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The board shall keep a record of these changes and the reason behind them and place a copy in the permanent records of the annual conference maintained by the secretary of the conference. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>l)</i> To ensure confidentiality in relation to the interview and reporting process.

There are occasions when the board of ordained ministry would not report privileged information, which in the judgment of the board, if revealed in the executive session of clergy members in full connection with the annual conference, would be an undue invasion of privacy without adding measurably to the conference&rsquo;s information about the person&rsquo;s qualifications for ordained ministry. However, it is the right of the executive session of the clergy members in full connection with an annual conference to receive all pertinent information, confidential or otherwise, related to the qualifications and/or character of any candidate or clergy member of the conference.</sub><sup>81</sup></sub><br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>m)</i> To be in consultation with the bishop through the chairperson or the executive committee regarding transfers.

A conference transferring a person with less than three years of active service into another conference may require reimbursement either from the person or from the receiving conference for outstanding obligations for theological education financed through conference funds. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;3.
