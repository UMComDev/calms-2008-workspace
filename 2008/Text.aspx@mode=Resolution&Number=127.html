Mission Personnel in the United States <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, mission personnel in the United States, which includes church and community workers, US-2s, mission interns, summer interns, community developers, rural chaplains, lay missioners, and others, have faithfully and effectively enabled The United Methodist Church to facilitate mission and ministry across the United States in settings often neglected and overlooked by others; and <br> Whereas, for many people in the United States, life is becoming increasingly difficult, with the basic necessities of food, shelter, health care, job and educational opportunities, childcare, and transportation required for daily survival often being beyond reach; and <br> Whereas, God continues to hear the cries of the oppressed, impoverished, and neglected people; and <br> Whereas, God continues to call persons to offer themselves for service with the poor to provide both compassionate care and personal empowerment; and <br> Whereas, The United Methodist Church, with its unique Wesleyan traditions of identity and advocacy with the poor and its historical focus on social issues and human development, is challenged by God to be radically attentive and responsive to marginalized and dispossessed people and to bear responsibility for keeping their plight before the total church and world community; and <br> Whereas, mission personnel in the United States provide leadership&nbsp;&nbsp;vital to initiate and maintain cooperative ministries, including communities of shalom and missionary programs, and other efforts<b> </b>that focus attention on the needs of women, children, youth, racial and ethnic populations, the aging, and people with disabilities in both rural and urban areas; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church reaffirm its commitment to impoverished people and oppressed communities in the United States by creating and maintaining among its highest levels of priority the recruitment, training, and placement of mission personnel in the United States who can enable people, churches, and communities to move beyond their present circumstances to participate in healthy, whole communities; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that new and innovative means of providing financial support for mission personnel in the United States be developed as The United Methodist Church at all levels confronts the challenge to deal with limited available resources. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> Amended and Readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
