Complaint procedures &ndash; 1. When a complaint is presented which intends to change a pastor&rsquo;s conference relationship, or when a pastor refuses to voluntarily accept a change of conference relationship based on legitimate concerns about his or her ministry, the Cabinet members shall follow what is directed in this paragraph.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that effort fails, then Cabinet members shall follow the procedures of P 362, seeking reconciliation, restoration, and justice where possible through the processes described there. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. An oral complaint that threatens a pastor&rsquo;s conference relations must be put in writing by the alleging victim or an eye witness of the events alleged to have taken place, including time and place, before the pastor may be confronted with it by anyone in any process leading up to and including Paragraph 362.&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, if actions related to leave of absence (P 354), involuntary retirement (P 359), or administrative location (P 362.4c) are being considered, the written signed complaint must be prepared prior to the initiation of those actions and shared with the pastor before those actions may begin. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Cabinet members shall not avoid Paragraph 362 by refusing to admit there is a complaint or by not allowing an oral complaint to be written down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Such avoidance of Fair Process is contrary to the intent of the Book of Discipline which is to seek reconciliation and restoration and not just seek punishment the easiest way anyone can think up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabinet members must act based on the Golden Rule because accusations could be made against them in the future and they would certainly want a chance to defend themselves against what could be spurious complaints. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Cabinet members shall not use coercive practices such as telling the pastor a meeting is for some other purpose and then ambushing him/her with their interpretation of the complaint in an attempt to intimidate and force an immediate &ldquo;voluntary&rdquo; decision to take leave or withdraw from ministry. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Because a Cabinet member has a superior position to any pastor because of the authority to help in the appointment process, he/she must refrain from any accusatory behavior, refrain from gossip about the complaint with other pastors or laity, and refrain from meeting alone with the pastor under complaint or with the complainant.&nbsp;&nbsp;Both parties shall be directed to obtain an advocate to assist in protecting their respective rights in any meetings related to the complaint. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6. A respected third party, preferably a trained mediator, shall be invited to meet with the two parties and their advocates to see if resolution can be obtained prior to initiating the supervisory response under Paragraph 362.&nbsp;&nbsp; Because of the power imbalance as well as because of the principle of separation of powers, no Cabinet member shall perform in this roll.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> 7. Cabinet members shall maintain the presumption of innocence toward the pastor and must seek to be pastoral to all parties involved in order to be able to fulfill responsibilities under Paragraph 362 once it has begun.<br /> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>8. The response of every Cabinet member to any complaint must be oriented toward reconciliation and restoration and justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is finally up to those of the annual conference assigned by the Discipline to provide the proper hearings to seek resolution, including further mediation and just resolution techniques.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complainants must understand that Cabinet members, including the bishop, have no substantive role in determining innocence or guilt.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cabinet members are restricted by the Discipline to facilitate the processes by which those can be, in good order, found.<br /> </b></b></b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Cabinets have tried to avoid following a complaint procedure by acting as though they were involved in supervision despite following up on a complaint, oral or written.&nbsp;&nbsp;This petition offers a clearer demarcation between supervision and processing a complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p></td>
