We recognize and deplore violence which kills and injures children and youth. In the name of Christ, who came <b>&ldquo;and proclaimed peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near&rdquo; (Ephesians 2:17) and challenged all his disciples to be peacemakers (Matthew 5:9)</b><strike> so that persons might know abundant life</strike> , we call upon the church to affirm its faith through vigorous efforts to curb and eliminate gun violence. Gun violence is killing <strike> America's</strike>&nbsp;children<b> throughout the world, including the United States</b>. <b>In the United States alone, </b><strike> Based on statistics from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms,</strike>&nbsp;there are an estimated 223 million firearms <strike> in the United States</strike> . Approximately one out of every <strike> four<b></strike>&nbsp;three</b> households owns a handgun. The risk of handgun violence to children and youth is more prevalent in the United States today than in any previous generation. <strike> Our c<b></strike> C</b>ommunities and schools <b>in the United States </b>are so exposed to large numbers of privately owned guns that no mere attempts at providing slightly better security can match the awful threat of guns finding their way through our well-intentioned safety systems. <strike> A significant total reduction in the numbers of guns in our communities is our goal in ministry. We serve and our society's <b></strike> Many </b>children go to school amidst passionately violent segments of current youth culture. No appeals to individual autonomy are sufficient to justify our church's ignorance of this threat. The need to prevent the incidence of firearm-related injury and death is an issue of increasing concern and a priority <strike> U.S.</strike>&nbsp;public health issue. The United Methodist Church is among those religious&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> communions calling for social policies and personal lifestyles that bring an end to senseless gun violence. Gun violence in <strike> America's <b></strike> U.S. </b>schools has emerged as a growing and disturbing trend. The United Methodist Church supports ministries that address the issue of violence and crime prevention for children/youth in urban areas through the Communities of Shalom. Violence is no longer confined to the streets of urban areas but has occurred at an increasing rate in<b> U.S.</b> suburban communities. Over the past several years, high-profile cases of school shootings involving suburban youth killing and injuring teachers and peers alike have once again brought the issue of guns and youth to the forefront of national attention.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Amnesty International reports that hundreds of thousands of people throughout the world are killed every year because of the unregulated small arms trade. The small arms trade, which includes such arms as assault weapons and shoulder-fired missiles, is legal but out of control. Amnesty International reports that as many as 639 million small arms and light weapons are in circulation around the world. The small arms trade incites local conflicts, which so often leads to unnecessary human rights abuses. The proliferation of small arms has led to the forced recruitment of children into war and local ethnic conflicts escalating into destabilizing regional warfare. We urge all nations where there is a presence of The United Methodist Church to participate in the process of developing a legally-binding Arms Trade&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /> <b>Treaty through the United Nations to regulate the transfer of all small arms and light weapons so as to curb gun violence throughout the world. </b><br /> These acts of senseless violence should not be an acceptable occurrence in any community: suburban, urban, or rural. The church must continue to address these issues of violence and develop programs to enrich the lives of all children/youth. In light of the increase of gun violence affecting the lives of children and youth, we call upon The United Methodist Church to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;convene workshops of clergy and <strike> other</strike>&nbsp;mental health care professionals from communities (urban, rural, and suburban) in which gun violence has had a significant impact in order to discuss ways by which The United Methodist Church should respond to this growing tragedy, and to determine what role the church should take in facilitating dialogue to address the issue of gun violence in our schools and among our children;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;educate the United Methodist community (parents, children, and youth) on gun safety, violence prevention, adult responsibility around gun violence prevention, and the public health impact of gun violence;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identify community-based, state, and national organizations working on the issue of gun violence and seek their assistance to design education and prevention workshops around the issue of gun violence and its effect on children and youth;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;develop advocacy groups within local congregations to advocate for the eventual reduction of the availability of guns in society with a particular emphasis upon handguns, handgun ammunition, assault weapons, automatic weapons, automatic weapon conversion kits, and guns that cannot be detected by traditionally used metal detection devices. These groups can be linked to community-based, state, and national organizations working on gun and violence issues;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;support federal legislation <b>in the U.S. Congress </b>to regulate the importation, manufacturing, sale, and possession of guns and ammunition by the general public. Such legislation should include provisions for the registration and licensing of gun purchasers and owners, appropriate background investigation and waiting periods prior to gun purchase, and regulation of subsequent sale;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call upon all governments of the world in which there is a United Methodist presence to establish national bans on ownership by the general public of handguns, assault weapons, automatic weapon conversion kits, and weapons that cannot be detected by traditionally used metal-detection devices;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call upon the print, broadcasting, and electronic media, as well as the entertainment industry, to refrain from promoting gun usage to children;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;discourage the graphic depiction and glorification of violence by the entertainment industry, which greatly influences our society, and recommend that these issues be addressed through education and consciousness raising;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;call upon the federal and state governments to provide significant assistance to victims of gun violence and their families; <strike> and </strike> <br /> 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recommend that annual conferences make visible public witness to the sin of gun violence and to the hope of community healing<strike> .<b></strike> ; and </b><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>11. reflecting the traditional role of The United Methodist Church has been one of safety and sanctuary, every United Methodist Church is officially declared a weapon-free zone. </b><br /> ADOPTED 2000&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> See Social Principles, ¶ 164F.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b><br /> <br /></p></td>
