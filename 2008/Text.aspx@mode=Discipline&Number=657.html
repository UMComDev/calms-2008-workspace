<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶<b>&nbsp;657.</b> 1. A district conference shall be composed of members as determined and specified by the annual conference, giving attention to inclusiveness (<i>see </i>¶¶&nbsp;124, 138). <br> 2. The district conference may choose its own order of business. The secretary duly elected shall keep an accurate record of the proceedings and submit it to the annual conference for examination. <br> 3. The district conference shall issue certificates of candidacy for the ordained ministry on recommendation of the district committee on ordained ministry and shall consider for approval the reports of this committee. <br> 4. The district conference may incorporate a district union, under the laws of the state in which it is located, to hold and administer district real and personal property, receive and administer church extension and mission funds for use within the district, and exercise such other powers and duties as may be set forth in its charter or articles of incorporation as authorized by the annual conference having jurisdiction over said district. All such district unions chartered or incorporated by districts of the churches that joined and united in adopting the Constitution of The United Methodist Church are declared to be disciplinary agencies of The United Methodist Church as though originally created and authorized by that Constitution and may act for or as a district conference when convened for that purpose by the district superintendent, who shall be its executive secretary, or by its president or other executive officer. <br> 5. If any district or conference initiates, joins, monitors, or terminates a boycott, the guidelines in <i>The</i> <i>Book of Resolutions</i>, 2004, should be followed. The General Conference is the only body that can initiate, empower, or join a boycott in the name of The United Methodist Church. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
