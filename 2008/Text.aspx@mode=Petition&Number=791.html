Article IV as follows:</b><br /> <b>¶ 35</b> The <strike> ordained</strike>&nbsp;ministerial delegates to the General Conference and to the jurisdictional or central conference shall be elected by <strike> and from the ordained ministerial</strike>&nbsp; <b>the</b> <b>clergy</b> members in <strike> full connection with</strike>&nbsp;the annual conference or provisional annual conference. <br /> </b></b><b>Amend ¶ 316.6 as follows for purposes of consistency: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b>¶ 316.6 </b>The membership of local pastors under full-time and part-time appointment is in the annual conference where they shall have the right to vote on all matters except <strike> constitutional amendments, election of delegates to general, jurisdictional, or central conference, and</strike>&nbsp;matters of ordination, character, and conference relations of clergy. <br /> <b>Amend ¶ 318.5 as follows for purposes of consistency: <br /> ¶ 318.5 </b>Local pastors, except student local pastors, may serve on any board, commission, or committee with voice and vote, except on matters of clergy character, qualifications, status, and ordination, except the board of ordained ministry and the district committee on ordained ministry (¶ 634.1). <strike> They shall not be eligible to vote on or serve as delegates to the general, jurisdictional, or central conference.</strike>&nbsp; <br /> <b>Amend ¶ 602.1 c & d as follows for purposes of consistency: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b>¶ 602.1 c </b>Associate <strike> and Affiliate</strike>&nbsp;clergy members shall have the right to vote in the annual conference on all matters except <strike> constitutional amendments, election of clergy delegates to the general and jurisdictional or central conferences, and on</strike>&nbsp;matters of ordination, character, and conference relations of clergy. <br /> <b>Add ¶ 602.1 c 2 for purposes of clarity. <br /> ¶ 602.1 c 2 </b><strike> Associate and</strike>&nbsp;Affiliate clergy members shall have the right to vote in the annual conference on all matters except constitutional amendments, election of clergy delegates to the general and jurisdictional or central conferences, and on matters of ordination, character, and conference relations of clergy. <br /> <b>Amend ¶ 602.1 d for purposes of clarity. <br /> ¶ 602.1 d </b>Full-time and part-time local pastors under appointment to a pastoral charge shall have the right to vote in the annual conference on all matters except <strike> constitutional amendments, election of clergy delegates to the general and jurisdictional or central conferences, and on</strike>&nbsp;matters of ordination, character, and conference relations of clergy. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Denial of voting rights for Associate Members and local pastors means that many of our urban and rural local churches and pastors have no voice or vote in who represents them as clergy at general, jurisdictional, and central conferences. This amendment would redress that injustice. <br /> <br /></p></td>
