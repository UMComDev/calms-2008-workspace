<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>INVESTMENTS <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>213. Investment Ethics <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The United Methodist Church and its predecessor denominations have a long history of witness for justice in the economic order. John Wesley and early Methodists, for instance, were staunchly opposed to the slave trade, to smuggling, and to conspicuous consumption. In fact, John Wesley refused to drink tea because of its relationship to the slave trade. Social creeds adopted by our predecessor churches, beginning in 1908, stressed social justice in the economic world, with special attention to the exploitation of child labor and inhumanely long working hours. <br> Throughout this century our church has promoted decent working conditions and the right to organize and bargain collectively, and it has opposed discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, ethnic background, gender, age, or disability. Historically our tradition has opposed church investments in companies manufacturing liquor or tobacco products or promoting gambling. <br> Since the 1960s, our denomination and its predecessors have built a solid record expressing our ethics in our investment decisions. United Methodist agencies and conferences fought against the manufacture of napalm and were involved in the social-justice issues raised by religious shareholders. In the mid-1970s, the General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) began official social responsibility guidelines for general church investments. <br> While the issue of economic sanction against <i>apartheid</i> in South Africa engaged us more than any other, United Methodist agencies, affiliated institutions, conferences, congregations, and individual members have brought the church&rsquo;s Christian witness to business on numerous issues, including employment discrimination, environmental preservation, militarism, nuclear weapons production, reevaluation of infant formula use and addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The church also continues to advocate on such issues as: international fair labor practice; domestic and global human rights; lending practices or policies for lesser developed communities and nations; and issues of violence to persons, firearms sales, gun policies; best corporate governance practices, unethical corporate practices, environmental reporting, public disclosure on financial risks of global warming and climate change, genetically modified organisms and food safety. <br> We affirm that all financial resources of the church and its members are God-given resources, to be held in trust for use or investment in ways that promote the reign of God on earth. <br> Further, we recognize that every investment has ethical dimensions. Financial investments have consequences that are both fiscal and social. We believe social justice and social usefulness must be given consideration together with financial security and financial yield in the investment of funds by United Methodist Church agencies and affiliated institutions, and by congregations as well as individual United Methodists. Socially responsible investing by Christian institutions and individuals must take account of both sets of considerations. <br> Our church&rsquo;s witness through investments has taken four forms, each of which may be employed with the others. They are: <br> 1.<i> Avoidance by Divestment</i>. This policy prohibits investment in enterprises that have policies or practices that are so morally reprehensible that investment in these companies is not tolerated by the church. Our denomination traditionally has avoided investments in liquor, tobacco, and gambling. Historically many church investors have refused to invest in major military contractors, companies with nuclear weapons contracts, or companies when they were doing business in South Africa under <i>apartheid</i>. In some cases, they have divested of such companies, making public their action as a moral statement. <br> 2. <i>Affirmative Choice.</i> This strategy is to choose intentionally enterprises for investment based on careful consideration of return, both in social values and in social justice, as well as financial security and monetary profit. For United Methodist investors, the Social Principles and <i>The</i> <i>Book of Resolutions</i> delineate the social goals to which we expect all our investments to make a positive contribution. But with certain affirmative investments we may seek a very specific social outcome, such as the construction of affordable housing, the renewal of a particular neighborhood, or the expansion of business ownership to those traditionally excluded. <br> 3. <i>Shareholder Advocacy</i>. The practices of corporations in which the church invests may fall short of the moral standards expressed in the Social Principles and <i>The</i> <i>Book of Resolutions.</i> Responsible Christian investing includes seeking to change company policies and practices for the better. Church investors have, as shareholders of corporations, engaged corporate management in a great variety of ways-from gentle persuasion to public pressure, from dialogue to voting proxies to filing shareholder resolutions, and building coalitions. In many cases, corporate policies have changed as a result. <br> 4. <i>Strategic Partnerships</i>. This is the practice of working in collaboration with others to utilize synergy of strategies and resources to engage corporations on issues of governance, environmental and social importance. Such partnerships may include: United Methodist boards, agencies, foundations, universities, concerned socially responsible investors, domestic and global faith-based and non-governmental organizations. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><i>Policy and Implementation of Policy <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>The policy goals of the General Conference of The United Methodist Church, its general agencies, and entities under its control shall be: <br> 1. to invest as much as possible in entities that are making a positive contribution to the communities, societies, and world on which they have impact and to the realization of the goals outlined in the Social Principles and <i>The</i> <i>Book of Resolutions</i> of our church; <br> 2. to employ this combination of socially responsible approaches that contribute to economic justice and corporate responsibility: <br> <i>Avoidance by nonpurchase or divestment of holdings in companies that:</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; produce tobacco products or alcoholic beverages, or manage or own gambling enterprises, or have as their primary business the production, distribution, or sale of pornographic material; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rank among the top 100 Department of Defense (DOD) contractors (those receiving the largest volume of prime contract awards) for the past three years; and have DOD contracts larger than 10 percent of sales for voting securities and 5 percent of sales for nonvoting securities; the GCFA shall publish the listing of the top 100 DOD contractors annually; provided, however, health care providers and humanitarian relief providers are not intended to be excluded even if they rank in the top 100 DOD contractors. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make components for nuclear explosive devices; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manufacture chemical or biological warfare materials; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make components for anti-personnel weapons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have as their primary business the production, distribution or sale of handguns and assault-type weapons or ammunition for such weapons; or <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; manufacture, or purchase through subcontracting, a significant amount of products made with sweatshop or forced labor. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affirmative investing in companies, banks, funds, or ventures that are seeing specific targeted social goals upon which the church places high value, such as those that: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; encourage recycling and use recycled products; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work within legally imposed discharge limits for toxic chemicals, noise, and water temperature; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; do not sell chemicals that would be banned in the company&rsquo;s country of origin; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; obtain future power supplies from renewable resources that do not have undue adverse environmental, socioeconomic and human rights impacts upon indigenous peoples; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invest in low-income housing, affordable housing, and community development in urban and rural areas; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; invest in companies that have positive records in hiring and promoting women and racial and ethnic persons;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are companies owned by women and by racial and ethnic persons; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have programs, benefits and wages that assure quality of life for employees and their families; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; have policies and practices that preclude predatory or harmful lending practices. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shareholder advocacy through which the agency exercises its rights as shareholder to persuade corporations to end irresponsible behavior or live up to high ethicalstandards by using any combination of the following approaches: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>letter of inquiry or expression of its position to management; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> dialogue with management; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> voting proxies; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> soliciting votes from other investors for a particular reason; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> sponsoring resolutions for votes at stockholder meetings; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> speaking at stockholder meetings; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> legal action; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> publicity; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> working in coalitions with other concerned shareholders; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> petitioning the SEC or Congress for changes in the proxy rules; <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. To seek opportunites to invest in companies, banks, funds, or ventures that invest or have operations in African and other poor countries, provided that those countries respect human and labor rights and have a record of trying to raise living standards of their people and work to maintain ecological integrity. <br> 4. To encourage companies to adopt, implement and monitor for compliance a supplier code of conduct consistent with the International Labor Organization&rsquo;s core labor standards that will prevent the manufacture or purchase through subcontracting of products made with sweatshop or forced labor. <br> 5. To seek opportunities to commend corporations publicly for greater transparency and disclosure, socially responsible behavior, and for endeavors to raise industry standards on social issues that are major concerns of The United Methodist Church. <br> 6. To consider using investment-portfolio managers and funds that specialize in corporate social responsibility screening. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Council on Finance and Administration is assigned responsibility by <i>The</i> <i>Book of Discipline</i> for preparing and distributing the Investment Guidelines that must be used by all general agencies receiving general church funds, including social responsibility guidelines. The council shall periodically review and update these guidelines as needed, inviting the counsel of the agencies and other interested sectors of the church. The council encourages the active involvement of investing agencies in the overview of socially responsible investing described in this policy. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All general agencies receiving general church funds shall file a copy of their investment policy with the General Council of Finance and Administration. It shall be available upon request to any interested member of the church. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These policy goals are strongly recommended to all the institutions affiliated with The United Methodist Church and any of their entities, and to the annual conferences and local churches and any funds of foundations related to them. It is also recommended that a copy of their social responsibility investment guidelines be available upon request by any United Methodist Church member. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Where financial considerations preclude immediate divestment of securities held in violation of the above policy goals, boards, agencies, and institutions of The United Methodist Church shall develop a plan for meeting the criteria that will bring them into compliance no later than the 2008 General Conference. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These policy goals are also strongly recommended to all<br> individual United Methodist investors and users of financial services. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOPTED 1992<br> AMENDED AND ADOPTED 2000<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 163<i>D. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
