<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>114. Support for the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, The United Methodist Church was a founding member of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice in 1973, and <br> Whereas, the General Board of Church and Society and the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries are currently members of the Religious Coalition, along with national organizations from 14 denominations, including the Episcopal Church, Presbyterian Church (USA), United Church of Christ, Unitarian Universalism, Reform and Conservative Judaism, and <br> Whereas, these Coalition member organizations hold a wide variety of views regarding policies relating to specific issues of reproductive choice such as when life and personhood begins but, nevertheless, share common religious values, have official pro-choice policies, and are committed to working together to ensure reproductive choice for all persons through the moral power of religious communities, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, the Religious Coalition supports the right of all persons to have access to a wide range of reproductive health services including sexuality education, family planning services, contraception, abortion services, affordable and quality health and child care, and <br> Whereas, the Religious Coalition&rsquo;s All Options Clergy Counseling program trains clergy of many faiths to assist women in discerning the course of action that they believe is best in a case of unintended pregnancy, and <br> Whereas, internationally, the Religious Coalition is an accredited non-governmental organization with the United Nations Department of Public Information which supports international family planning services in such areas as South Africa where the Coalition works with churches on HIV/AIDS education and prevention, and <br> Whereas, the Coalition&rsquo;s efforts help counter attempts to enact restrictive legislation that would impose specific religious views about abortion and reproductive health on persons of all faiths, and <br> Whereas, factions within the United Methodist Church whose stated goal is to have the General Conference go on record in opposition to all abortions regardless of the reason are working towards the goal of severing all United Methodist ties with the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the United Methodist 2004 General Conference go on record in support of the work of the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice, and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i>&nbsp; that the 2004 General Conference affirm the continued membership of the General Board of Church and Society and the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries in the Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See </i>Social Principles, Â¶ 162T. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
