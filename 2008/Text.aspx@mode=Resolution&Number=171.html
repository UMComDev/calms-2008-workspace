Ministries of Rural Chaplains <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the General Conference of 1996 clearly affirmed the ministries of rural chaplains and called on The United Methodist Church to pursue rural chaplaincy as a significant means of resourcing renewal in rural churches and communities throughout the world; and <br> Whereas, the Rural Chaplains Association now has 201 certified members (women, men, laity and clergy, United Methodist and ecumenical) including African Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics, Native Americans, and persons from the international community (England, Philippines, Russia) with several persons in process from Mexico, and has initiated relationships with representatives from Africa, Australia, and Canada; and <br> Whereas, the Report on the National Comprehensive Plan for Town and Country Ministry, mandated by the General Conference of 1996, states that &ldquo;Rapid changes are occurring in town and country . . . including the looming loss of thousands of family farms, the changing face of agricultural production, the growth of ethnic/migrant and other new populations; the emerging challenges of forestry, mining, fisheries and other industries such as small manufacturing and prisons; the prevalence of `Appalachian-like&rsquo; economies in many places changing patterns of use and control; and struggles over environmental issues, water quality and hazardous waste disposal&rdquo;; and <br> Whereas, rural communities in the United States and worldwide continue to experience: losses of agricultural employment and processing, mining, timbering, textile industries and of small family-owned businesses; a shortage of needed leadership and opportunities for youth; losses of human service institutions; exploitation of their poor and powerless; the destruction of environment; and lack of a balance of political power; and <br> Whereas, special learning events have been provided to rural chaplains on: long-term rural-family crisis; ministry in the midst of hate and violence; and the administrative and ministering capabilities of cooperative parish ministries, <i>shalom</i> ministries and ecumenical ministries in rural settings; and <br> Whereas, the Rural Chaplains Association has given significant attention to the causes and effects of the escalating control of agricultural and food products by powerful multinational corporations upon rural communities within the United States and the world; and <br> Whereas, rural chaplains are recognized as a special type of mission personnel of the General Board of Global Ministries for town and rural settings, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church commend and reaffirm its commitment to rural chaplains and request the Rural Chaplains Association to increase its work nationally, internationally, and ecumenically with lay and clergy rural chaplains, many of whom carry out their ministries under trying conditions and in difficult places; and, <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Board of Global Ministries be commended for its support of rural chaplaincy as a significant means of resourcing the renewal of rural churches and communities throughout the world, and that the board be encouraged to continue its support of the Rural Chaplains Association in the future. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See </i>Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>N</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
