We believe persons may be fully human only when that gift is acknowledged and affirmed by themselves, the church, and society. We call all persons to the disciplined, responsible fulfillment of themselves, others, and society in the stewardship of this gift. We also recognize our limited understanding of this complex gift and encourage the medical, theological, and social science disciplines to combine in a determined effort to understand human sexuality more completely. We call the Church to take the leadership role in bringing together these disciplines to address this most complex issue. Further, within the context of our understanding of this gift of God, we recognize that God challenges us to find responsible, committed, and loving forms of expression.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Although all persons are sexual beings whether or not they are married, we believe sexual relations are only clearly affirmed in the <strike> marriage bond</strike>&nbsp; <b>bonds of marriage or covenant relationship</b>. Sex may become exploitative within as well as outside marriage. We reject all sexual expressions that damage or destroy the humanity God has given us as birthright, and we affirm only that sexual expression that enhances that same humanity. We believe that sexual relations where one or both partners are exploitative, abusive, or promiscuous are beyond the parameters of acceptable Christian behavior and are ultimately destructive to individuals, families, and the social order. <br /> We deplore all forms of the commercialization and exploitation of sex, with their consequent cheapening and degradation of human personality. We call for strict global enforcement of laws prohibiting the sexual exploitation or use of children by adults and encourage efforts to hold perpetrators legally and financially responsible. We call for the establishment of adequate protective services, guidance, and counseling opportunities for children thus abused. We insist that all persons, regardless of age, gender, <b>gender identity</b>, marital status, or sexual orientation, are entitled to have their human and civil rights ensured. <b>We encourage civil authorities to enact laws that will ensure full civil and economic rights for persons in civil unions and marriages without regard to the gender of the partners.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> We recognize the continuing need for full, positive, age-appropriate and factual sex education opportunities for children, young people, and adults. The Church offers a unique opportunity to give quality guidance and education in this area. <strike> Homosexual persons no less than heterosexual persons</strike>&nbsp; <b>All </b>persons are individuals of sacred worth <b>regardless of age, gender, gender identity, marital status, or sexual orientation</b>. All persons need the ministry and guidance of the church in their struggles for human fulfillment, as well as the spiritual and emotional care of a fellowship that enables reconciling relationships with God, with others, and with self. <strike> The United Methodist Church does not condone the practice of homosexuality and consider this practice incompatible with Christian teaching. We</strike>&nbsp; <b>While Christians of good faith differ on what Christian teaching reveals regarding homosexuality, we</b> affirm that God's grace is available to all, and we will seek to live together in Christian community. We implore families and churches not to reject or condemn <strike> lesbian and gay</strike>&nbsp;members and friends based on <b>sexual orientation or gender identity</b>. We commit ourselves to be in ministry for and with all persons. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Our Doctrinal History ¶102 states: &ldquo;United Methodists respect the diversity of opinions held by conscientious persons of faith.&rdquo; While Christians of good faith are not of one mind regarding scripture and the practice of homosexuality, Wesley followed the approach: &ldquo;In essentials, unity; in non-essentials, liberty; and in all things, charity.&rdquo;<br /></p></td>
