<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b>Section XII. Mentoring and Mentors <br> </b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>¶&nbsp;349. <i>Mentors</i>-1. Mentors shall be recommended by the cabinet, selected, trained and held accountable by the board of ordained ministry. There are two categories of mentor, each with distinct functions and responsibilities as follows: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> Candidacy mentors are clergy in full connection, associate members, or full-time local pastors who have completed the Course of Study trained to provide counsel and guidance related to the candidacy process. Candidates will be assigned a candidacy mentor by the district committee on ordained ministry in consultation with the district superintendent (¶&nbsp;311). Candidacy mentors will work with the candidate until that candidate begins serving in an appointive ministry as a local pastor or a commissioned minister. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b)</i> Clergy mentors are clergy in full connection, associate members, or full-time local pastors who have completed the Course of Study trained to provide ongoing oversight and counsel with local pastors and probationary members pursuing ordained ministry. Local pastors will be assigned a clergy mentor by the district committee on ordained ministry in consultation with the district superintendent. Probationary members will be assigned a clergy mentor in full connection by the conference board of ordained ministry in consultation with the district superintendent. A candidacy mentor may continue with the same person if trained to serve as a clergy mentor. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Mentoring occurs within a relationship where the mentor takes responsibility for creating a safe place for reflection and growth. An effective mentor has a mature faith, models effective ministry, and possesses the necessary skill to help individuals discern their call in ministry. Mentoring is a part of the preparation and growth for inquirers and candidates for ordained ministry, local pastors and probationary members of an annual conference. Mentoring is distinct from the evaluative and supervisory process that is a part of preparation for ministry. <br> 3. The conference board of ordained ministry may assign one mentor to work either with one individual or with a group of local pastors and/or probationary members. Persons transferring from other denominations will also be assigned a clergy mentor (¶ 347.3.b). <br> 4. Clergy mentoring begins when a person receives an appointment as a local pastor or as a commissioned minister entering probationary service. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
