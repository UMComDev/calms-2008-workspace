<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b>Section XI. Clergy from Other Annual Conferences, Other Methodist and Christian Denominations <br> </b></b><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>¶&nbsp;346. <i>Provisions for Clergy from Outside the Annual Conference</i>-Ordained clergy or probationary members from other annual conferences and Christian denominations may receive an appointment in the annual conference in the following manner: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;1. <i>Ordained Clergy or Probationary Members from Other Annual Conferences and Other Methodist Denominations</i>-With approval and consent of the bishops or other judicatory authorities involved, ordained clergy or probationary members of other annual conferences or other Methodist churches may receive appointments in the annual or missionary conference while retaining their home conference membership or denominational affiliation. Appointments are to be made by the resident bishop of the conference in which the clergy person is to serve. If appointment is to a missionary conference, the terms of the appointment shall be as provided in ¶ 586.4. Otherwise upon the recommendation of the board of ordained ministry, clergy in such appointments may be granted voice but not vote in the annual conference to which they are appointed. Their membership on conference boards and agencies is restricted to the conference of which they are a member. They shall be compensated no less than the equitable salary provisions of the annual conference in which they serve and participate in the pension and insurance programs of that annual conference. Such appointments are renewable annually. Furthermore, it shall be the responsibility of the board of pensions of the annual conference in which the appointment is received to enroll such clergy in the Ministerial Pension Plan and the Comprehensive Protection Plan (<i>see</i> ¶&nbsp;1506.21).</sub><sup>33 <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></sub>2. <i>Elders or Ordained Clergy from Other Denominations</i>-On recommendation of the board of ordained ministry, the clergy members in full connection may approve annually clergy in good standing in other Christian denominations to serve appointments or ecumenical ministries within the bounds of the annual conference while retaining their denominational affiliation; <i>provided</i> they present suitable credentials, give assurance of their Christian faith and experience, and release required psychological reports, criminal background and credit checks, and reports of sexual misconduct and/or child abuse. They shall submit, on a form provided by the conference board of ordained ministry: a notarized statement detailing any convictions for felony or misdemeanor or written accusations of sexual misconduct or child abuse; or a notarized statement certifying that the candidate has not been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, or accused in writing of sexual misconduct or child abuse. They shall give evidence of their agreement with and willingness to support and maintain United Methodist doctrine, discipline, and polity. Their ordination credentials shall be examined by the bishop and the board of ordained ministry and, upon its recommendation, may be recognized as valid elders in The United Methodist Church while they are under appointment. When the board of ordained ministry certifies that their credentials are at least equal to those of United Methodist elders, they may be accorded the right to vote in the annual conference on all matters except the following: <i>(a)</i> constitutional amendments; <i>(b)</i> election of delegates to the general and jurisdictional or central conferences; <i>(c)</i> all matters of ordination, character, and conference relations of ministers. They may serve on any board, commission, or committee of an annual conference, except the board of ordained ministry and the board of trustees (¶¶&nbsp;634.1, 2512.1). They shall not be eligible for election as delegates to the general, jurisdictional, or central conferences. They shall also be subject to the provisions governing sabbatical leave, leave of absence, location, retirement, minimum salary, and pension. They shall not have security of appointment. <br> </sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Between conference sessions, the board of ordained ministry may approve them for appointment pending the recognition of their orders. The bishop may make <i>ad interim</i> recognition of valid ordination after consultation with the cabinet and executive committee of the board of ordained ministry, pending recognition by the vote of the clergy members in full connection. In every case, prior examination shall be made of the ordained minister&rsquo;s understanding, acceptance, and willingness to support and maintain United Methodist doctrine, discipline, and polity.</sub><sup>34 <br> </sup></sub>33. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 16, 361, 554. <br> 34. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 444. <br> </sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;
