<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶<b>&nbsp;2551.</b> <i>Covenant Relationships in Multi-Ethnic and Multi-Language Settings</i>-In situations where a local church or churches share a building with a congregation or with another group performing ministries in different languages and/or with different racial and ethnic groups, it shall be in accordance with ¶¶&nbsp;202, 206, and 212. The district superintendent must consent to any such action before implementation. The district board of church location and building must be informed of such action. <br> 1. If the congregations are United Methodist, the following shall apply: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> By action of the charge conference(s) involved, a covenant relationship shall be mutually agreed upon in written form and shall include a statement of purpose for sharing the facility and shall state whether the agreement is seen as temporary, long-term, or permanent. The covenant of relationship may provide for mutual representation <br> </i></i>11. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 420. <br> on such bodies as church council and other committees and work groups. The board of trustees of the church that holds title to the property may form a property committee composed of representatives of each congregation. The purpose of this arrangement is to enhance communication between the two or more congregations, to coordinate schedules and building usage, to involve the congregations in building maintenance and care under supervision of the board of trustees, and to coordinate cooperative programs. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b)</i> No United Methodist congregation shall pay rent to another United Methodist church. However, each congregation should be expected to pay a mutually agreed share of building expenses. <br> <i>c)</i> Congregations that share the same facility and other properties are encouraged to organize and share intentionally in some mutual ministries to strengthen their relationships and their effectiveness when focusing on the same objectives. Cooperative programs may be developed that enhance the ministry of both congregations and their witness to the love of Jesus Christ in the community. Such programs may include joint bilingual worship services and Christian education programs, fellowship meals, and community outreach ministries. <br> <i>d)</i> Each congregation in a shared facility is strongly encouraged to accept an interdependent relationship in reference to use of the facility. Such a relationship affirms cooperatively planned and executed programs and activities as well as independently planned and executed programs and activities. Thus, scheduling programs and using the facility will be implemented in a manner that contributes to the positive growth of each congregation. <br> <i>e)</i> In situations where local congregations and/or ministries that share facilities cannot negotiate decisions that are supportive mutually by each congregation or ministry, the district superintendent shall consult with the leadership of each congregation and/or ministry prior to the implementing of any decision that may adversely affect the future of either congregation or ministry. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If a United Methodist church is sharing with a congregation of another denomination, the following should apply: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> Prior to agreeing to share facilities with a congregation that is not United Methodist and is of a different ethnic or language background, the United Methodist pastor and the district superintendent shall first contact district and conference congregational development agencies and ethnic leadership to explore the possibilities of organizing as an ecumenical shared ministry or a new United Methodist congregation with that ethnic or language group. <br> <i>b)</i> If it is decided that the United Methodist congregation and the congregation of another denomination should share facilities, as a part of the covenant of mission, a property-use agreement shall be negotiated in writing in accordance with ¶&nbsp;2503; this agreement shall have the consent of the district superintendent and shall be approved by the United Methodist charge or church conference. Shared activities may be entered into to enhance the ministry of both congregations. A liaison committee to both congregations may be appointed to resolve conflicts, clear schedules, and plan cooperative activities. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Ninety-day notification of intent to terminate the covenant relationship shall be made to the district superintendent and to the other parties in the covenant relationship. This termination shall require the consent of the district superintendent following consultation with the parties involved. <br> 4. The district committee on religion and race shall monitor all consultations and plans related to the transfer or use of property to ensure fairness and equity in situations involving two or more local congregations or ministries. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
