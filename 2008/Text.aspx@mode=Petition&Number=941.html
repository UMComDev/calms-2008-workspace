By being aware of how the pastors under their supervision are doing by reviewing past and current statistics, reading newsletters, worshipping with their churches, dropping in on special events, being aware of the general demographic trends of the area, and personal discussions with the pastors, the superintendent will get a picture of how the pastors are doing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Occasionally, letters or phone calls of complaint about performance may point out weaknesses or mistakes the pastors are making. <br /> </b></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>b) When the superintendents determine to intervene because they realize the pastor has missed meetings on specific dates, has been inept at handling a specific wedding or funeral, has failed to produce a cogent sermon, refuses to visit church members, who does not visit church families in crisis, etc. (with names and dates and places on any performance issue), they shall meet face to face with the pastor to go over these lapses. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) After considering health issues the pastor may have which might need physical or mental examinations (which could lead to incapacity leave under P 358), the superintendent and pastor shall go over the events illustrating the problems to determine what kind of help may improve the pastor&rsquo;s performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;d) The superintendent and pastor shall develop a plan of action which the two agree could help resolve the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan which shall include a date by which the plan should have been completed and the results known shall be in writing and the two shall sign and date it. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e) Within a week of the conclusion of the plan&rsquo;s time frame, the superintendent and pastor shall meet to discuss the effect and value of the activities, examining recent events in which the problems might have come up prior to the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan has been the help the pastor needed and the problems no longer persist, the matter shall be considered resolved. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f) Should the matter not be resolved or should it appear again some time later, the superintendent and pastor shall meet again to discuss how it is the help did not resolve the problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is clear the help sought was not correct, the two shall seek out a more helpful resource and prepare a plan of action including the time frames worked out as in the first consultation.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the problem is not the effectiveness of the plan but the pastor&rsquo;s failure to follow through as helped in the plan of action, the superintendent and pastor shall work out a second plan of action which both agree should resolve the problem, perhaps including more supervision by the Staff-Parish Relations Committee or other mutually respect person or group knowledgeable about the kind of help being provided, and both shall sign and date t h e agreement. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;g) Within a week of the conclusion of the second plan&rsquo;s time frame, the superintendent and pastor shall meet to discuss the effect and value of the activities and examine recent events in which the problems might have come up prior to the <br /> plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan has been the help the pastor needed and the problems no longer persist, the matter shall be considered resolved. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h) If the plan of action and subsequent experience show no improvement in performance, again the two shall evaluate the plan for its effectiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan is seen to be flawed by both pastor and superintendent, they shall seek other alternatives that should work better.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the plan is not seen to be flawed, then the two shall establish a third plan of action, signed and dated.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, the superintendent shall strongly encourage the pastor to also seek career counseling&nbsp;&nbsp;since this third plan is the last chance the pastor has to upgrade performance before action under Paragraph 362 is brought. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i) If at the end of the time frames agreed upon in the third plan of action the performance of the pastor improves and the prospects are determined to be good by the superintendent and pastor (and those who have been brought in to help), the matter shall be considered resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the performance is not improved to the satisfaction of the superintendent and those brought in to help, the file containing the dated signed agreements, superintendent&rsquo;s notes, complaints put in writing, the superintendent&rsquo;s summary and recommendation for action relating to the pastor&rsquo;s conference relations, and the pastor&rsquo;s written responses to any of those materials shall be the basis for a formal complaint under Paragraph 362 signed by the superintendent as witness to the supervisory efforts to help the pastor. <br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Superintendents need guidance about how to work with incompetent and ineffective pastors under their supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;These practices are consistent with most employment practices of comparable institutions to the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;They show respect toward pastors and go a reasonable distance to restore the pastors to effectiveness.<br /></p></td>
