The provisions of these mandatory benefit programs shall be incorporated by reference into the <i>Discipline</i> and shall have the full force of law as if printed in the <i>Discipline</i>. No proposal shall be made to the General Conference that changes a benefit presently in effect without first securing through the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits an actuarial opinion concerning the cost and other related aspects of the proposed change. <br> 2.
