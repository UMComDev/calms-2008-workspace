A central conference organization may become a member of the World Federation of Methodist Women and may elect a representative to the World Federation of Methodist Women within the provisions of the federation. <br> 2.

Further, the judicial court shall hear and determine the legality of any action of an annual conference taken under the adapted portions of the <i>Discipline</i> or of a decision of law by the presiding bishop of the annual conference pertaining to the adapted portion of the <i>Discipline,</i> upon appeal of the presiding bishop or of such percentage of the members of the annual conference as may be determined by the central conference concerned. <br> 4.

This committee shall be composed of youth, young adults, and adult leaders of youth or young-adult ministry from each annual conference in the central conference.
