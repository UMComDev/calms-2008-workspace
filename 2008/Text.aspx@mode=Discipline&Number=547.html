Further, the judicial court shall hear and determine the legality of any action of an annual conference taken under the adapted portions of the <i>Discipline</i> or of a decision of law by the presiding bishop of the annual conference pertaining to the adapted portion of the <i>Discipline,</i> upon appeal of the presiding bishop or of such percentage of the members of the annual conference as may be determined by the central conference concerned. <br> 4.
