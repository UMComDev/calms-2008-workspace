MANDATE <br /> </i>The 2004 General Conference of The United <br /> Methodist Church through the adoption of Petition <br /> 41379 mandated that a study on the relationship <br /> between The United Methodist Church and the <br /> Autonomous Methodist Churches in Latin America <br /> and the Caribbean be conducted during the <br /> 2004&ndash;2008 quadrennium. </b>The study was to include an <br /> analysis of the present relationships, ways of improving <br /> the relationships, and the identification of opportunities <br /> for mission collaboration. The aforementioned study <br /> committee was further given the responsibility of developing <br /> and implementing a consultation process with the <br /> leaders of the autonomous Methodist churches in the <br /> Latin America/Caribbean region that would allow the <br /> voice of the churches in the Latin American/Caribbean <br /> region to be heard through the sharing of their concerns, <br /> but also their hopes and aspirations. <br /> For these purposes a study committee was organized. <br /> It is composed of 12 persons, three from the <br /> Council of Bishops, three from the General Board of <br /> Global Ministries, three from the General <br /> Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious <br /> Concerns, and three from Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean. In an effort to be good stewards of our <br /> resources the study committee has done much of its <br /> work by conference call and e-mail, but it did hold a <br /> research and planning meeting in February 23-25, <br /> 2006 in S&#227;o Paolo, Brazil, and then conducted a <br /> major consultation on March 1-4, 2007 in Panama <br /> City, Panama. This consultation gathered representatives <br /> from all of the Autonomous Methodist Churches <br /> in Latin America and the Caribbean, representatives <br /> from the general agencies of The United Methodist <br /> Church, and the Study Committee. The following section <br /> presents the recommendations forthcoming from <br /> the Panama Consultation. <br /> <b><i>II. RECOMMENDATIONS FROM <br /> THE PANAMA CONSULTATION <br /> </b></i>On March 1-4, 2007 the Study Committee conducted <br /> a major consultation with the autonomous <br /> Methodist Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean <br /> in Panama City, Panama. Delegations of bishops, presidents, <br /> and other leaders from each of the Methodist <br /> churches of Latin America and the Caribbean participated <br /> in the consultation. The following recommendations <br /> forthcoming from this consultation are now <br /> presented to the 2008 General Conference of The United <br /> Methodist Church for its consideration and action. <br /> <b><i>RECOMMENDATION #1 <br /> </b></i>Together we must redefine and deepen the concept <br /> and understanding of our Connectionality for the <br /> enhancement of relationship, building programs that <br /> will enable the fulfillment of the mission of the church. <br /> Our Connectionality must reflect a spirit of inclusivity, <br /> koinonia, mutuality and respect. To fulfill this proposal <br /> we would recommend that we: <br /> <b>A. Affirm a mutuality in Mission </b>that extends <br /> itself in both directions, from The United Methodist <br /> Church to the Methodist Churches of Latin America and <br /> the Caribbean, and from the Methodist Churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean to The United <br /> Methodist Church. <br /> This mutuality needs to find expression in all that <br /> we do together including in the areas of our . . . <br /> Evangelization and Discipleship <br /> Missions <br /> Pastoral and Theological formation <br /> Christian Education <br /> Projects of Sustainable Development <br /> Worship and Liturgical Renewal <br /> <b>B. Create a committee on Connectional <br /> Program </b>composed of representatives from The United <br /> Methodist Church, the Council of Evangelical <br /> Methodist Churches of Latin America (CIEMAL) and <br /> the Methodist Churches of the Caribbean and the <br /> Americas (MCCA). This committee should include representation <br /> from the Council of Bishops of The United <br /> Methodist Church, the Council of Bishops and <br /> Presidents of the Methodist Churches of Latin America <br /> and the Caribbean, the general agencies of The United <br /> Methodist Church, the United Methodist Holistic <br /> Strategy for Latin America and the Caribbean <br /> Committee as well as such representatives from <br /> CIEMAL and the MCCA. <br /> The Committee on Connectional Program will meet <br /> once during the quadrennium. The expenses for the participation <br /> of the representatives of The UMC will be covered <br /> by the respective sending agencies. The participation of the <br /> representatives from Latin America and the Caribbean will <br /> be covered by The United Methodist Church, through <br /> funding designated by the General Conference. <br /> Funding request: $10,000 <br /> <b>C. Encourage an ongoing program of visitation <br /> of Bishops (i.e., the Council of Bishops&rsquo; Global <br /> Visitation, etc.) and other leaders of The UMC </b>(i.e., <br /> Volunteers In Mission, General Board of Global <br /> Ministries visits, the Holistic Strategy for Latin America <br /> and the Caribbean, etc.) to the Methodist Churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean, and facilitate the visitation <br /> of the Bishops and lay and clergy leaders of the <br /> Methodist churches of Latin America and the Caribbean <br /> to The United Methodist Church to engage in direct and <br /> horizontal communication that would facilitate a better <br /> understanding of the realities of each mission partner&rsquo;s <br /> context of ministry and mission. <br /> <b>D. Support and enable direct relationships <br /> between the local churches and Annual Conferences <br /> of The United Methodist Church with the Methodist <br /> Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean. <br /> E. Activate the Conference of Methodist <br /> Bishops, </b>as provided for by <i>The Book of Discipline of <br /> The United Methodist Church 2004</i>, to serve as a forum <br /> where closer relationships can be developed between the <br /> Bishops of The United Methodist Church and the <br /> Bishops and Presidents of the Methodist Churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean. <br /> <b><i>RECOMMENDATION #2 <br /> </b></i>We must commit to openness in our communication <br /> with each other. We believe that open channels of <br /> communication can enable us to overcome past mistakes, <br /> create a transparency that will facilitate healing in <br /> those places where we experience brokenness, and <br /> allow for the healthy sharing of power. Open and transparent <br /> communication should be affirmed and extended <br /> to all levels of the church. Our channels of communication <br /> presently need to be clarified to facilitate a better <br /> process of consultation and dialogue. To fulfill this proposal <br /> we would recommend that: <br /> <b>A. All communications of The United Methodist <br /> Church and its agencies be conducted through the <br /> official, established and recognized lines of authority <br /> </b>of the Methodist Churches of Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean in the official language of the receiving <br /> churches. <br /> <b>B. </b>In the same spirit of mutual accountability, that <br /> <b>all communications of the Methodist Churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean also be conducted <br /> through the official, established and recognized lines <br /> of authority </b>of The United Methodist Church. <br /> <b>C. Encourage the Web page managers of The <br /> United Methodist Church and Methodist churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean</b>, including their <br /> councils and cooperative organizations such as <br /> CIEMAL and MCCA, to include links to each other&rsquo;s <br /> Web pages as means of communication and information <br /> sharing on our common life and mission. <br /> <b>D. All General Conference documents be translated <br /> into Spanish and made available to delegates <br /> whose language preference is Spanish. <br /> <i>RECOMMENDATION #3 <br /> </b></i>We are convinced that the Methodist churches of <br /> Latin America, the Caribbean, and the general agencies <br /> of The United Methodist Church, the United Methodist <br /> Council of Bishops, and the Connectional Table of The <br /> United Methodist Church, must seek to find a balance in <br /> their mutual programs of evangelization and diakonia, <br /> in order to more fully express the whole mission of God. <br /> To fulfill this proposal we would recommend that: <br /> <b>A. The United Methodist Church accompany <br /> the Methodist Churches of Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean in together being a prophetic voice in the <br /> face of the multiple social justice issues </b>that create <br /> suffering among God&rsquo;s people in the Latin American <br /> and Caribbean contexts, giving particular attention to <br /> social injustices caused directly and indirectly by the <br /> international policies and involvement of the government <br /> of the United States. <br /> <b>B. </b>Within a framework of holistic mission, evangelization <br /> and diakonia, The United Methodist Church <br /> through its general agencies, <b>seek means to further the <br /> task of evangelization and the growth of the <br /> Methodist work in Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean. <br /> C. </b>The general agencies of The United Methodist <br /> Church, in consultation with the Methodist Churches of <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean, <b>intentionally and <br /> cooperatively develop and direct a Holistic Strategy <br /> for Latin America and the Caribbean. <br /> </b>The Holistic Strategy for Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean will meet once a year in conjunction with the <br /> meetings of the Directive Board of CIEMAL and <br /> including representation from the Methodist Church of <br /> the Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA). The expenses <br /> for the participation of the representatives of The United <br /> Methodist Church will be covered by the respective <br /> sending agencies. The expenses for an additional day of <br /> the meetings of the Directive Board of CIEMAL will be <br /> covered by The UMC, through funding designated by <br /> the General Conference. <br /> Funding request: $10,000 <br /> These recommendations are best understood in the <br /> clarifying light of our shared history. We highly commend <br /> the following historical summaries to you for your <br /> consideration. <br /> <b><i>III. OUR HISTORY OF <br /> RELATIONSHIP <br /> </b></i>The action of the 2004 General Conference reflects <br /> the desire of The United Methodist Church to better <br /> understand its past, present and future relationships with <br /> the Latin American and Caribbean region. The United <br /> Methodist Church and its predecessors have related to <br /> this region for more than 165 years. The ties that bind <br /> our churches are enriched by the exchange of missionaries, <br /> volunteers and resources. United Methodists have <br /> strong partners in the autonomous Methodist churches <br /> of Latin America and the Caribbean. The study of our <br /> relationships that has been conducted during the 2005- <br /> 2008 quadrennium represents the continuation of a journey <br /> of discernment within our shared Wesleyan <br /> connection. <br /> The depth of the historical ties and profound faith <br /> relationships between the people called Methodist of <br /> Mexico, the Caribbean, and Central and South <br /> America and United Methodists has enriched our mission <br /> history. The roots of Methodist communities in <br /> the Latin America/Caribbean region are on the island <br /> of Antigua (Caribbean), where a congregation of Afro- <br /> Caribbean slaves developed in the 1760s; it was the <br /> first Methodist congregation outside of England and <br /> Ireland. Within the Spanish Caribbean, Methodism in <br /> British and African Methodist Episcopal expressions <br /> has been present on the Island of Hispaniola <br /> (Dominican Republic and Haiti) since the 1820s. In <br /> South America, Methodist work was begun in 1836 in <br /> Brazil and Argentina, and in 1838 in Uruguay through <br /> mission initiatives from Methodists in the United <br /> States. With the major exception of British mission <br /> outreach along the eastern coast of Central America, <br /> the Dominican Republic, and Haiti, most Methodist <br /> mission initiatives in the region came from the predecessor <br /> denominations of The United Methodist <br /> Church: Mexico (1873), Cuba (1883), Chile (1878), <br /> Peru (1888), Puerto Rico (1900), Bolivia (1906), <br /> Panama (1906), Costa Rica (1918), and the Dominican <br /> Republic (1922). At the time of the formation of The <br /> United Methodist Church (1968), the Evangelical <br /> United Brethren Church was involved in mission work <br /> in Brazil, Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Puerto <br /> Rico. In recent years, new Methodist communities <br /> have developed in Guatemala, Ecuador, El Salvador, <br /> Nicaragua, Columbia, Venezuela and Paraguay, and a <br /> United Methodist mission initiative is currently underway <br /> in Honduras. <br /> Early mission outreach throughout the region was <br /> frequently met by hostility, even violence, and some followers <br /> of the Methodist way paid for their faith by <br /> imprisonment, social exclusion, and even martyrdom. <br /> This heritage of fidelity is treasured by the Methodists <br /> of the region, and is a reality that has few parallels in <br /> U.S. Methodism. <br /> In the early years, oversight of mission initiatives <br /> was the responsibility of bishops from the United States, <br /> mission agencies, and mission superintendents. The <br /> General Conference of 1920 formed a Central <br /> Conference, a regional organization, with two episcopal <br /> areas in Latin America. <br /> The Methodist Church of Brazil, experiencing significant <br /> growth in the early years of the 20th century, <br /> petitioned both the 1922 and 1926 General Conferences <br /> to provide episcopal leadership that would be resident in <br /> that country, a practice which would become the norm <br /> in Africa, Europe, and the Philippine Central <br /> Conferences. The failure of the General Conference to <br /> act in favor of its petition led Brazil to become an <br /> autonomous Methodist Church in 1930. In that same <br /> year, the Methodist Church in Mexico, facing hostile <br /> anti-American sentiment because of the Mexican politi- <br /> cal situation of the day, also made the decision to <br /> become an autonomous Church. <br /> Over the years a growing concern among a number <br /> of the Latin American churches was the need to have <br /> greater possibilities for self-determination and identity. <br /> The volatile anti-American political situations in Cuba <br /> and other countries during the 1960s and 1970s underlined <br /> the need for denominational legislation that would <br /> permit flexibility in changing and complex situations <br /> and contexts. <br /> The Methodist Church of the Caribbean and the <br /> Americas (MCCA), constituted in 1967 by churches <br /> developed through British Methodist mission efforts, <br /> entered into a relationship with The United Methodist <br /> Church as an affiliated autonomous church. It, along <br /> with Mexico and Puerto Rico, now has a Concordat <br /> relationship with The United Methodist Church that <br /> grants it representation and full participation in the <br /> General Conference of The United Methodist Church. <br /> <b><i>IV. HISTORIC ACTIONS <br /> </b></i>The General Conference Commission on the <br /> Structure of Methodism Overseas (COSMOS), formed <br /> in 1948 to address the situation of non-U.S. churches, <br /> brought a recommendation to the 1968 General <br /> Conference that enabled churches desiring autonomy to <br /> more easily take the step toward autonomy. The <br /> Methodist Church of Cuba became autonomous that <br /> year, and in 1969 Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Peru, and <br /> Bolivia followed, with Costa Rica and Panama becoming <br /> autonomous in 1973. In 1992 the Methodist Church <br /> of Puerto Rico became autonomous and, after a 12 year <br /> transitional process, developed a concordat with The <br /> United Methodist Church that was approved by the 2004 <br /> General Conference of The United Methodist Church. <br /> The 1968 COSMOS recommendation that there be <br /> representation of autonomous churches on the General <br /> Board of Global Ministries was not acted upon. Thus, <br /> Central Conferences have a presence within the Board <br /> of Directors of the General Board of Global Ministries, <br /> helping to identify and shape responses to their needs, <br /> but there is no one on this Board of Directors to speak <br /> for or see through the eyes of those from Latin America <br /> and the Caribbean. Historically, Latin America ranked <br /> with Africa and Asia as United Methodist mission priorities, <br /> receiving major commitments of staff leadership, <br /> missionary personnel, financial resources and program. <br /> Today, however, many perceive that this commitment <br /> has become considerably less when compared to funding <br /> and commitments extended to other regions of the <br /> world. <br /> At the 1968 General Conference of The United <br /> Methodist Church, COSMOS was disbanded and it was <br /> determined that all matters related to autonomous <br /> churches would be referred to the General Conference <br /> Committee on Central Conference Affairs. This decision <br /> has had serious negative consequences for the <br /> autonomous churches. Any concerns raised by the <br /> autonomous churches are considered in a situation <br /> where they are without representation and by a body <br /> which is, in fact, constituted to advocate for Central <br /> Conferences rather than for autonomous churches. <br /> Indeed, this has tended to put a vast part of the <br /> Methodist work in the world &ldquo;off the map&rdquo;. <br /> The 1968 General Conference did commit The <br /> United Methodist Church to give the same importance <br /> to the autonomous churches as it would give to United <br /> Methodist Central Conferences. It seems clear that this <br /> has not happened. Thus, the action of the 2004 General <br /> Conference, calling for a study of relationships with <br /> action recommendations to the 2008 General <br /> Conference, is a recognition of the unsatisfactory nature <br /> of the present situation and the inadequate state of the <br /> connection in the Western Hemisphere. <br /> Although Latin American leaders desired and advocated <br /> greater self-determination as a necessary step for <br /> effective mission in their contexts, a number of Latin <br /> American, as well as some U.S. leaders, regret that the <br /> 1968 decision was itself not more flexible in that it did <br /> not provide for alternative avenues of relationship adaptable <br /> in changing situations. Behind this regret is the <br /> conviction that Wesleyan theology and ecclesiology do <br /> not support the concept of &ldquo;full autonomy&rdquo; for any unit <br /> within the Methodist connection. John Wesley&rsquo;s very <br /> assertion of the world as his parish makes the case for <br /> close linkages among Methodist brothers and sisters <br /> everywhere. <br /> In 1998 twenty-two Latin American bishops, representing <br /> the 17 member churches of CIEMAL (Council <br /> of Evangelical Methodist Churches of Latin America <br /> and the Caribbean), stated in a message to the United <br /> Methodist Council of Bishops: &ldquo;We yearn, along with <br /> you, to strengthen the bonds of connectionality of the <br /> churches of Latin America and The United Methodist <br /> Church.&rdquo; In response, the Council stated: &ldquo;The Council <br /> of Bishops is committed to strengthening the bonds that <br /> bind us together.&rdquo; A joint meeting of the Council of <br /> Bishops and the Bishops and Presidents of the churches <br /> of CIEMAL and The Methodist Church of the <br /> Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA) in 2002 in Puerto <br /> Rico was an important and historic step in this process. <br /> Indeed the Council of Bishops of The United <br /> Methodist Church has long been open to receive the <br /> charisma and wisdom of one bishop from the <br /> autonomous churches. However, the challenges and <br /> opportunities for us to walk together as good stewards in <br /> mission and ministry for the sake of the Gospel and <br /> Christ&rsquo;s own compelling call to us to be one, encourage <br /> us to seek even deeper connections with our Methodist <br /> brothers and sisters of Latin America and the Caribbean. <br /> The 2004 General Conference action to approve <br /> Holistic Strategies for Africa and Latin America and the <br /> Caribbean underlines the extraordinary opportunities <br /> and urgent need to strengthen our relational and mission <br /> partnership in the hemisphere. <br /> <b><i>V. CONCLUSION <br /> </b></i>As we have done our work it became clear to us <br /> that we needed to find ways to further document the history <br /> of our relationships with the autonomous Methodist <br /> Churches of Latin America and the Caribbean as well as <br /> articulate our understanding of what it means to be a <br /> connectional church. We have been gifted by the good <br /> work of Dr. Robert Harman and Dr. Wilson Boots as <br /> they have provided a summary of the history of our relationships. <br /> Bishop Aldo M. Etchegoyen, General <br /> Secretary of the Council of Evangelical Methodist <br /> Churches in Latin America and the Caribbean <br /> (CIEMAL), Bishop Peter D. Weaver of the Boston Area <br /> of The United Methodist Church, and the Rev. Dr. <br /> George Mulrain, President of the Methodist Church of <br /> the Caribbean and the Americas (MCCA), have helped <br /> us to gather our fundamental theological perspectives on <br /> autonomy and connectionality. We include these significant <br /> contributions for your study and reflection. <br /> We who have had the privilege of serving on the <br /> Study Committee have been deeply blessed. We have <br /> grown in our understanding of what it means to be the <br /> people called Methodist. Our own commitment to the <br /> value of our Methodist connectionalism has been deepened <br /> and strengthened. Along the way we have <br /> lamented the lost opportunities to be one in mission and <br /> ministry with our Methodist brothers and sisters from <br /> Latin America and the Caribbean. We are hopeful, however, <br /> for our future together and pray that the 2008 <br /> General Conference many be inspired by God&rsquo;s own <br /> Holy Spirit to find a way to strengthen our connectional <br /> ties with our sisters and brothers of Latin America and <br /> the Caribbean for the sake of the very work that Christ <br /> Jesus has mutually given us. <br /> <b>We would move the adoption of this report and <br /> the recommendations made within it. <br /> </b>Respectfully and Prayerfully Submitted, <br /> <i>Bishop Minerva G. Carca&#241;o, Chair <br /> </i>Lonnie Brooks, Secretary <br /> <i>Bishop Joel N. Martinez <br /> Bishop Juan Vera <br /> Dr. Aida Fernandez <br /> Dr. Randy Day <br /> Dr. Larry Pickens <br /> </i>Marcia Fitzner <br /> <i>Bishop Elias G. Galvan <br /> Bishop Aldo M.
