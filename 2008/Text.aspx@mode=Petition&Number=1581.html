With certain conditions, <br /> general boards and commissions receiving support <br /> from the general funds of the church are eligible to participate <br /> in this program. Those units of general agencies <br /> authorized to receive general Advance special support <br /> are not eligible to participate in this giving program. <br /> <b><i>Administration of Program <br /> </b></i>General oversight of the program shall be by GCFA <br /> and will include establishment of basic approval criteria <br /> and a project approval process developed in consultation <br /> with the Connectional Table (CT). The responsibility for <br /> the receiving and distribution of World Service Special <br /> Gifts funds to the administering agencies shall reside <br /> with the General Council on Finance and Administration. <br /> After approval by the General Council on Finance <br /> and Administration, basic cultivation and promotion for <br /> each project shall be done by the respective agency to <br /> specific audiences known to them to be interested in the <br /> particular aspect of ministry represented by the <br /> approved project. Some very limited general name identification <br /> promotion shall be done by the General <br /> Commission on Communication (UMCom). This shall <br /> be done on request of the administering agencies by <br /> common agreement. The amount of such general promotion <br /> and the costs shall be negotiated among the participating <br /> agencies, which are GCFA, UMCom, and <br /> those general boards and commissions eligible to <br /> administer World Service Specials. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> This program shall be reviewed and evaluated prior <br /> to the end of the 2009-2012 quadrennium by GCFA in <br /> consultation with the administering agencies and the CT. <br /> Any recommendation as to the future of the funding program <br /> shall be made jointly by GCFA and the CT to the <br /> General Conference in 2012. <br /> <b><i>Guidelines for Operating the World Service <br /> Specials Program <br /> </b></i>GCFA shall be responsible for the oversight of the <br /> program which shall include organizing a committee for <br /> providing basic project approval criteria and developing an application process, approving projects, and providing <br /> adequate staff administration and program accountability. <br /> There shall also be provision for representation <br /> by the CT and for consultation with the administering <br /> agencies. <br /> The procedures, administration guidelines, and criteria <br /> to be used by GCFA committee are as follows: <br /> 1) Project recommendations shall be made in a <br /> form and at times specified by GCFA. <br /> 2) Well-defined measurable goals shall be stated <br /> in each project application. <br /> 3) Project recommendations shall be specifically <br /> related to one or more of the Disciplinary functions <br /> of the recommending agency. <br /> 4) Specific project recommendations within a <br /> continuing program shall be for projects that <br /> are substantially new. <br /> 5) Project recommendations shall include both a <br /> specific total dollar target and a statement of <br /> what funds would be involved from other <br /> sources. <br /> 6) Project recommendations shall include a statement <br /> of both the minimum funds needed in <br /> order for the project to begin as well as the <br /> total optimum funding sought. <br /> 7) A well-defined budget shall be included within <br /> the project recommendation showing both <br /> expenses and outside sources of income (i.e., <br /> the project needs matching funds from participating <br /> conferences, registration fees, etc.). The <br /> budget shall spell out precisely what the World <br /> Service Special&rsquo;s monies being sought would <br /> be used for within the total program and <br /> budget. <br /> 8) Project recommendations shall include a categorical <br /> listing by the recommending agency of <br /> those specific constituencies who will be cultivated <br /> to contribute to the recommended project. <br /> 9) Project approval will be for a stipulated period <br /> of time not to exceed the end of the current <br /> quadrennium. Project renewals must be <br /> requested no later than the last council meeting <br /> of GCFA in the year preceding General <br /> Conference. <br /> 10) A specific project recommendation shall contain <br /> a time schedule, including: 1) when the <br /> project should begin; 2) the time span needed <br /> for completion; and 3) the expected date of its <br /> completion. The application shall relate <br /> whether the project would remain valid and for <br /> how long, even if its start-up date is not able to <br /> be met. <br /> 11) Promotional costs related to the project and the <br /> source from which they will be paid shall <br /> clearly be identified in the application and may <br /> not be disbursed without prior approval of the <br /> General Council on Finance and <br /> Administration. Promotional costs are not to be <br /> paid from World Service Special Gifts fund <br /> monies. <br /> 12) Funds promoted for a specific approved project <br /> shall not exceed the amount approved for the <br /> project. If more funds are received than has <br /> been authorized for a given project, the administering <br /> agency shall contact the donor to negotiate <br /> the possibility of the gift going to other <br /> similar projects, and, if this is not possible, to <br /> return the gift. It is understood that the donor <br /> retains authority to stipulate the final use of the <br /> gift. <br /> 13) Each agency shall report annually to GCFA for <br /> each approved project showing contributions <br /> received, earnings on funds received, expenditures <br /> for such projects, and promotional <br /> expenses. GCFA will supply a summary report <br /> of World Service Special programs to the CT <br /> for its information and inclusion in its evaluation <br /> of the overall effectiveness of the general <br /> program boards and commissions. <br /> <b><i>Administration of Funds <br /> </b></i>The procedures and guidelines to be used by GCFA <br /> for the administration of World Service Special funds <br /> received are as follows: <br /> 1) Generally, funds should be channeled from individual <br /> donors or churches through annual conference <br /> treasurers to GCFA and then disbursed <br /> to the agencies. Electronic giving channels will <br /> be available as an alternative avenue for donations. <br /> Insofar as donors identify their relationships, <br /> credit will be shown for local churches <br /> and annual conferences for funds received <br /> through electronic means. <br /> 2) Administering agencies shall be accountable to <br /> The General Council on Finance and <br /> Administration for the proper administration of <br /> all funds received. <br /> 3) No funds designated for a given approved project <br /> shall be used for any purpose other than the <br /> specific project as approved. <br /> 4) Administering agencies shall acknowledge the <br /> receipt of every gift to the primary donor. <br /> 5) The cost of the administering agencies for both <br /> general promotion and specific cultivation of <br /> each approved project shall be reported to and <br /> evaluated by GCFA annually. <br /> 6) Administering agencies are responsible for all <br /> fees and expenses associated with credit card, <br /> debit card, EFT, and ACH processing, including <br /> but not limited to: setup fees, monthly maintenance <br /> fees, bank fees, discount rate fees, and per <br /> transaction fees. Use of these services will comply <br /> with policies and procedures established by <br /> GCFA. <br /> <b><i>Promotion and Cultivation of the Program <br /> </b></i>The promotion and cultivation of this program <br /> requires two basic ingredients: general promotion for <br /> purposes of name identification and visibility in the <br /> Church, and specific cultivation of each specific <br /> approved project. World Service Special receipts shall <br /> not be used for general promotion, specific cultivation, <br /> nor general administration of the administering <br /> agency. <br /> General promotion shall be the responsibility of <br /> UMCom. It shall be limited in scope and only for the <br /> purpose of giving the funding program enough visibility <br /> in the general Church as to establish name recognition. <br /> Costs for this general promotion shall be borne by the <br /> administering agencies after consultation and mutual <br /> agreement among them as to the manner of determining <br /> the distribution of the total costs among them, as well as <br /> what that total cost will be. The manner of promotion <br /> shall be determined by UMCom after consultation and <br /> agreement with the involved administering agencies. <br /> Once agreement is reached, approval must be given by <br /> GCFA. <br /> Each administering agency that has approved projects <br /> in this program shall be responsible for the specific <br /> cultivation of those approved projects. The primary <br /> thrust of this cultivation shall be to specific audiences <br /> that have demonstrated previously their interest and concern <br /> for the ministry contained in that specific approved <br /> project. Costs to the administering agency shall be from <br /> within its regular budget, and approval must be given by <br /> GCFA.<br /> <br /></b></b></p></td>
