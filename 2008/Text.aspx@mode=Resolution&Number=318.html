Support Methodists in Portugal, Spain, and Italy <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the Methodist communities of the Iberian-Mediterranean countries of Portugal, Spain and Italy had their ongoing historical relationship with their respective founding Methodist bodies severed by events produced by the Second World War and its aftermath;<br> and <br> Whereas, in each of these countries, the state government in response to the interests of the Roman Catholic Church, declared illegal the presence and ministries of these Methodist churches, thereby disrupting their relationship with their founding bodies; and <br> Whereas, the commitment of these faithful few made possible the survival of Methodist Christians under this religiously adverse environment in Western Europe and struggle today to find new vitality and renewal, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that this General Conference of The United Methodist Church reaffirm our common history and mission with these churches, and celebrate their important and brave witness during the troubled times of this century in Western Europe. We call on the Council of Bishops, as well as the executive, program, and service staff of the general boards and agencies to develop a strategic approach to affirm, support, and strengthen the life of the Methodist Church of Portugal, The Evangelical Church of Spain, and the Methodist Church of Italy, by exploring jointly with the leadership of these respective churches (Bishop Ireneu da Silva Cunha, Portugal; President Enrique Capú, the Evangelical Church of Spain; President Valdo Benecchi, the Evangelical Methodist Church of Italy) ways to collaborate in those opportunities where common efforts will help usher in this new millennium, fresh vitality and renewed hope to these faith communities of our Methodist family. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 165<i>A.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
