<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>37. Eradication of Sexual Harassment<br> in The United Methodist Church and Society <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; Since the mid 1970&rsquo;s when the term &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; was first named by Lin Farley, the world has seen an extraordinary evolution in awareness, laws and litigation, policies, advocacy, and international collaboration to eradicate sexual harassment in the workplace. In our own communities we have moved from debating whether or not sexual harassment is even a problem to witnessing women and men join together across national boundaries to address it in multinational workplaces. Sexual harassment is regularly named as an element of </b>sexual violence in the U.S. and around the world. It is named as a priority problem in the Ecumenical Decade of Churches in Solidarity with Women in 1998, the UN Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995, the reports of the International Labor Organization, in courts martial in the US military, and position statements of the European Women&rsquo;s Lobby (EWL) to the European Union. It is the subject of major media attention when a coalition of women from the USA and Japan join to protest a multinational corporation&rsquo;s handling of it. <br> <CENTER><i>Legal and Policy Development in the U.S. <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>1970&rsquo;s: The earliest studies of U.S. workers showed that 40-60 percent of women and about 15 percent of men had experienced sexual harassment at work. In that same era, courts in the U.S. found that gender-based behavior that inhibited people from doing their job, and thus earning a living, violated laws prohibiting sex discrimination. <br> 1980: The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission issued guidelines on the identification and elimination of sexual harassment as an illegal form of sex discrimination in workplaces. Sexual harassment was defined as &ldquo;unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 1) submission to the conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual&rsquo;s employment, or 2) submission to or rejection of the conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or 3) the conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual&rsquo;s work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.&rdquo;<br> 1986: In a landmark decision, the U.S. Supreme Court in Meritor v. Vinson substantially clarified and strengthened the concept of &ldquo;unwanted conduct,&rdquo; named sexual harassment as a form of illegal sex discrimination, and found that companies may be held liable for the misbehavior of an employee against another. <br> 1992: The U.S. Supreme Court in a significant decision added another venue where sexual harassment is illegal-in the school classroom and playground, the college or university, and in the vocational training programs. The courts agreed that students, like workers, should not be demeaned, humiliated, or intimidated on the basis of their gender to the point it interferes with their education. Thus began extraordinary efforts to raise the awareness of teachers, students, parents, and communities that patterns of harassing behaviors can be started early. <br> 1998-99: In another landmark ruling, the Supreme Court ruled that schools may be held liable for students&rsquo; harassment of other students if officials knew about it and did nothing to stop it. This ruling in Davis v. Monroe came one year after the Court&rsquo;s five major rulings in 1998 increasing employers&rsquo; potential liability for harassment on the job. <br> In U.S. studies at the end of the 90&rsquo;s, 50-60 percent of women and 15-20 percent of men reported experiencing sexual harassment at work. While women are the predominant targets of harassment, men are targets as well with increasing numbers of reports coming from working men. At the close of the century, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission reported that the number of complaints of sexual harassment at work from women and men had increased eight times over this decade. <br> <CENTER><i>The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s Efforts <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>1908: The original Social Creed of The Methodist Episcopal Church contains the prophetic call to stand &ldquo;for such regulation of conditions of labor for women as shall safeguard the physical and moral health of the community.&rdquo;<br> 1981: The General Commission on the Status and Role of Women called for all United Methodist general agencies to have clear policies on sexual harassment for employees. All of the agencies responded and adopted policies. <br> 1988: Just two years after the first major ruling of the U.S. Supreme Court prohibiting sexual harassment in the workplace, the General Conference defined sexual harassment, named it as sin, and recognized it as a problem within our churches, agencies, and institutions. In early recognition of the importance of policies and procedures, the General Conference called for clear policies and procedures establishing grievance procedures for victims and penalties for offenders (<i>1996 Book of Resolutions</i>, p. 481). <br> 1990: The General Council on Ministries issued its report on a survey of United Methodist clergy, laity, college and seminary students, and nonclergy church employees (&ldquo;Sexual Harassment in The United Methodist Church&rdquo;). It concluded, &ldquo;The presence of sexual harassment in the environments associated with The United Methodist Church interferes with the moral mission of the church and disrupts the religious activity, career development, and academic progress of its participants. This study shows that unwanted sexual behavior takes place in a variety of circumstances in the church and has a range of negative consequences for its victims.&rdquo;<br> 1992: The General Conference called for every annual conference, agency, and United Methodist-related institution to have policies and procedures in place. While the General Board of Church and Society would continue to monitor and advocate for just laws eradicating harassment in society, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women was called on to assess the effectiveness of the church&rsquo;s efforts to eradicate it in our programs and structures. The General Conference added &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; as a &ldquo;chargeable offense&rdquo; for clergy and laity in ¶ 2702, <i>Book of Discipline</i>. <br> 1995: The General Commission on the Status and Role of Women conducted a survey of annual conferences in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Policies were in place in schools of theology and UM-related colleges and universities, general agencies, and in a majority of annual conferences. <br> 1996: Adopting the resolution, &ldquo;Sexual Abuse Within the Ministerial Relationship and Sexual Harassment Within The United Methodist Church&rdquo; (<i>1996 Book of Resolutions</i>, p. 128), the General Conference affirmed the progress made in training, education, and policy development over the previous quadrennium. In addition to this ongoing work, it called for all local churches to adopt policies and procedures, and it added ¶ 161<i>I</i> &ldquo;Sexual Harassment&rdquo; to the<i> Book of Discipline</i>. <br> 1998: A coordinated agency effort resulted in the &ldquo;Sexual Ethics in Ministry Survey&rdquo; of annual conferences in the U.S. Annual conferences identified what they needed in tools and resources to continue their own progress in healing, education, intervention and prevention of sexual harassment. <br> <CENTER><i>Evolving International Research and Policy <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>1980&rsquo;s: Research studies in Canada, Europe, and the former Soviet Union showed sexual harassment was widespread across international borders. While research methods varied from country to country, all the studies revealed the same thing: sexual harassment was a problem in the world&rsquo;s workplaces, with serious implications for its victims, the perpetrators, companies and organizations, and nations as a whole. It was a serious problem related to the abuse of power using gender to intimidate, coerce, demean, and humiliate. Whether the harassers were office workers, police officers, attorneys, or waiters, whether in Europe, North or South America, Asia, Africa or the Pacific region, the patterns of harassment and the impact on victims and witnesses looked the same from country to country.</sub><sup>1 <br> </sup></sub>Internationally, sexual harassment is seen as a barrier to the full participation of women in the workplace, and destructive to working environments for men and women.</sub><sup>2 <br> </sup></sub>1992: International studies (International Labor Organization 1992</sub><sup>3</sup></sub>) showed there are no typical victims of sexual harassment, but<br> those most likely to be harassed are those perceived as vulnerable and <br> &nbsp; 1. Susan L. Webb, Shock Waves: The Global Impact of Sexual Harassment, 1994.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp; 2. Jane Aeberhard-Hodges, &ldquo;Sexual harassment in employment: recent judicial and arbitral trends,&rdquo; <i>International Labour Review</i>, V. 135 N. 5, 1996. <br> 3. &rdquo;Violence at Work,&rdquo; <i>International Labor Organization Report,</i> survey of job violence and psychological harassment in 32 countries, 1999. <br> financially dependent . . . divorced, separated and widowed women,single parents, lesbians, racial/ethnic women, women working in traditionally male-dominated jobs, younger women, and temporary workers. The study found that women at particular risk for job violence are health care workers, teachers, social workers, taxi drivers, and retail workers. The ILO also found that while women are more likely to be harassed, men who are subjected to harassment have the same kind of vulnerabilities: young men new to the workforce, men working in jobs traditionally dominated by women, racial/ethnic men, and gay men. <br> &nbsp; 1998: At the closing event of the Ecumenical Decade of Churches in Solidarity with Women, &ldquo;sexual harassment&rdquo; appeared regularly in the testimonies of women and young women from many nations. In international gatherings, sexual harassment is regularly listed as one dimension of violence against women. Whether it was the UN Conference on Women in Beijing, the Conference on Development in Cairo, or the Decade Festival in Harare, these gatherings continue to identify the elimination of violence against women (physical, spiritual, psychological, sexual, structural, or economic) as a top priority for the world community. <br> 1999: In collaborative action, the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) established its Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence Against Women,</sub><sup>4</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;disbursing more than $600,000 in grants for local, regional, and global initiatives. This indicates a growing recognition by governments and local groups that violence against women is a fundamental violation of women&rsquo;s rights with devastating consequences for women&rsquo;s health and well-being and for society as a whole. <br> As the century closed, women&rsquo;s organizations in Europe, the U.S.A., South America, Africa, and Asia advocated for the eradication of sex&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ual harassment in the multinational workplace. One startling example of women and men coalescing to demand an end to this form of violence was the work of women&rsquo;s organizations in the U.S. with over fifty organizations in Japan to protest the actions of Mitsubishi following the allegations of sexual harassment in a U.S.-based plant. This high profile example of hostile work environment reminds us that &ldquo;Seku hara&rdquo; sexual harassment in any language, is harmful for workers, businesses, communities, and nations. <br> &nbsp; 4. UNIFEM Global Campaign to Eliminate Violence Against Women, 1999. <br> <CENTER><i>Why We Must Be Concerned? <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Generally, anyone can be a target in the workplace-women, men, youth, interns, volunteers, all racial/ethnic groups, any level of employee. In the learning place, any student of either gender, any grade, any teacher or professional, or any volunteer in a school program can be a target. In the church it can happen to a variety of persons, for example a staff person, pastor, committee or council chairperson, church school teacher or helper, student, camper, counselor, youth worker, or chaperone. The verb &ldquo;to harass&rdquo; is roughly translated &ldquo;to set a dog on someone.&rdquo; This is what harassment feels like to a victim; it is demeaning, humiliating, frightening, isolating, and intimidating. The experience can be devastating to the individual, damaging self-esteem, productivity, and ability to earn wages; and, it can result in illness, absenteeism, poor performance, loss of promotions and opportunities. For students it can result in failure, absenteeism, isolation from peers, loss of self-esteem and therefore learning potential, withdrawal from teams and groups, and illness. Families of targets and others in the work and learning place are also victims of the hostile, intimidating environment harassment creates. <br> There is good reason why Fortune 500 companies declared sexual harassment as the &ldquo;business issue of the 90&rsquo;s.&rdquo; There is sound moral reasoning behind The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s declaration that sexual harassment is a sin against individuals and communities, and is a chargeable offense for our clergy and laity. Even more profound are the devastating effects on persons when it happens in a faith community. Spiritual life, theological language and meaning, and relationships are jeopardized. For some, the loss of a sense of safety and sanctuary can be permanent. <br> <CENTER><i>What Now Must We Do? <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Worldwide, advocates of employed women have this concern: equal access for women to resources, employment, markets, and training in order to participate fully in their own economic development. To this end they call for the elimination of sexual harassment and other forms of discrimination in the workplace. Other issues include the need for comparable international data on the incidences of harassment against women at work across international boundaries; the implementation and enforcement of policies and laws that prohibit sexual harassment and gender-based violence in the workplace, and the urgency for governments and agencies worldwide to make contributions to initiatives seeking to raise awareness of young women and eradicate all forms of sexual violence. <br> In The United Methodist Church, we are aware that ongoing vigilance is needed to keep effective, updated policies and procedures in all places in the church. Regular, up-to-date training of our lay and clergy leaders is an ongoing ministry of our church. Advocacy and intervention teams have been working in many conferences, and every episcopal area needs to maintain working, effective channels and procedures. Since the children and youth in our church school and youth groups are experiencing this behavior at school, how much more could we as local churches do to resource and support them in recognizing, stopping, and dealing with sexual harassment in their own lives? <br> <CENTER><i>God&rsquo;s Call to Live in Hospitable Community <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Sexual harassment is a barrier to hospitality. This alienating, sinful behavior causes brokenness in relationships-the opposite of God&rsquo;s intention for us in human community. <br> From the first biblical stories of human community in the garden to the letters of Paul to the first Christian communities, we learn that all of us, both female and male, are created in the image of God, and thus have been made equal in Christ. From the beginning God intended<br> us to live out our equality in relationship with one another and in community. Yet in our brokenness, we have given greater value and power to some over others based on gender, race, culture, age, status, or ability. <br> Jesus&rsquo; ministry reminds us amid this brokenness that we can experience whole relationships with one another and with God. And thus we are called to be stewards of God&rsquo;s community of hospitality where there is not only an absence of harassment, but also the presence of welcome, respect, and equality. <br> <i>Therefore,</i> the General Conference calls for increased efforts worldwide to eradicate sexual harassment in the denomination and its institutions including these strategies:<i><br> </i>1. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women and the General Board of Global Ministries continue to work together with international women&rsquo;s organizations on efforts to eradicate violence against women in our communities worldwide; <br> 2. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women in collaboration with appropriate agencies continue to develop educational resources to assist United Methodists throughout the connection in understanding the issues of sexual harassment in church and society; <br> 3. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women in cooperation with the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry identify and develop resources on sexual harassment specific to those in ordained ministry and to lay leaders, students, faculty, and administrators of United Methodist-related educational institutions; <br> 4. episcopal leaders implement plans to address and eradicate sexual harassment in each episcopal area with attention to prevention, education, intervention, and healing measures; <br> 5. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women will continue to monitor and assess the church&rsquo;s progress in eradicating sexual harassment and will report to the 2004 General Conference the specific areas to be strengthened within the life of the church including policy development, education, and training; <br> 6. annual conferences throughout the connection will encourage their local and national governments to collect accurate data on the incidence and nature of sexual harassment in their workplaces. They will also encourage their national governments to adopt laws, policies, and procedures for eradicating sexual harassment. Annual conferences are encouraged to utilize this data and experiences to plan initiatives to raise awareness throughout the conferences; <br> 7. the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries will advocate for laws that prohibit sexual harassment in U.S. workplaces, and continue to provide resources to the denomination on international initiatives to eradicate harassment and other forms of violence against women; <br> 8. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women and the General Board of Global Ministries in collaboration with the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns will work cooperatively with the World Council of Churches &ldquo;Decade to Overcome Violence&rdquo; (2001-2010); and <br> 9. the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women shall continue to conduct ongoing self-assessment of The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s progress to eradicate this behavior from the church, and to strengthen initiatives to eradicate it from our diverse societies around the world. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> REVISED AND ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 161<i>I.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
