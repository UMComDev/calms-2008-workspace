Bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the earth- 7&nbsp;everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory, whom I formed and made." Isaiah 43:5-7 (New International Version).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </i><br /> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas: When the military bases pulled out in 1992 from the Philippines, they returned to the US taking almost everything. Very little was left behind except for most of the Amerasian children, fathered by American servicemen and tactical support civilians. These children, called Amerasians are still receiving a deaf ear and blind eye from Washington. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas: It is estimated that there are 50,000 Amerasians in the Philippines as a whole. <br /> These were the children of both our servicemen and civilian contractors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Amerasians in Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and Thailand are granted immediate US Citizenship but those born in the Philippines and Japan live outcasts and are given no special consideration from United States Government. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas: Amerasians, regardless of the specific country they where born, are Asian Americans. They could only become Amerasians by having one parent as an American at the time of their birth. In today's modern society, if an American woman gives birth to an Amerasian child, that child is automatically seen and accepted as a US citizen and have rights to immigrate to the US.&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas: When an Amerasian child is born of an American father, the situation changes drastically. Acceptance as a US citizen is questioned, criticized, and microscopically examined. <br /> Whereas: Public Law 97-359 was passed to set right for the unfortunate situation of Amerasians, who due to their illegitimate or blended race make up, have little or no possibility of evading their plight. However, the Filipino and Japanese Amerasians were excluded in eligibility because the Congress ruled that Philippines and Japan were not considered war zones. <br /> Whereas: Though the Philippines and Japan were not considered as war zones, the extent and nature of the U.S. military involvement in both countries were no different to U.S. military involvement in other Asian countries during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Philippines and Japan played vital roles during those times of war as supply and stationing bases that brought tens of thousands of U.S. military personnel to these countries. <br /> Whereas: Since they were as vital as the other Asian countries, why United States Government does not give Amerasians in these two countries the same equal rights similar to other Asian countries that are benefiting to PL 97-359. Filipino and Japanese Amerasians were no different to the Amerasians in Laos, Korea, Kampuchea, Thailand, or Vietnam. They were all fathered by American servicemen and contractors who the US government stationed in the Philippines and Japan to win the war against North Korea and Vietnam. <br /> Whereas:&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fourteenth Amendment<u> </u>mentions two types of citizenship: citizenship by birth and citizenship by law (naturalized citizens):&rdquo; All persons born in the United States are citizens by birth. Current US statutes define certain individuals born overseas as citizens by birth <br /> Whereas: The United States Congress has the power to define citizenship to children born outside the United States. Congress can set different citizenship requirements for children born to American mothers versus American fathers. <br /> Therefore be it resolved that the General Conference of the United Methodist Church petition the United States Government and the Supreme Court to declare that the current Public Law 97-359 is unconstitutional because the Constitutional Law base on jus sanguinis (the right of blood) where nationality is determined by the nationality of one's descent (parents). <br /> Therefore be it resolved: that the General Conference of the United Methodist Church petition our State Senators and State Representatives to amend Public Law 97-359 to extend and grant US Citizenship to Filipino and Japanese Amerasians and give them the rights to immigrate to the United States of America to join their parents and to give them the chance to have a better life free from oppression. <br /> </b><br /> <br /></p></td>
