The body of Christ is one; yet many members with differing functions are all joined together in the one body (1 Corinthians 12:28).</strike>&nbsp; <b>Bishops and superintendents are elders in full connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>1. Bishops are <strike> elders in full connection who are elected from the elders and set apart for a ministry of general oversight and supervision (¶ 401).</strike>&nbsp; <b>elected from the elders and set apart for a ministry of servant leadership, general oversight and supervision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>As followers of Jesus Christ, <strike> called to servant leadership,</strike>&nbsp; <strike> bishops are authorized to guard the faith, order, liturgy, doctrine, and discipline of the Church; to seek and be a sign of the unity of the faith; to exercise the discipline of the whole Church; to supervise and support the Church's life, work, and mission throughout the world; and to lead all persons entrusted to their oversight in worship, in the celebration of the sacraments, and in their mission of witness and service in the world. Bishops carry a primary responsibility to support and encourage the ministry of all Christians. They share with other bishops in the supervision of the whole Church, encouraging and supporting all baptized people in the exercising of their gifts and ministries, praying for them, and proclaiming and interpreting to them the gospel of Christ. Bishops are to be prophetic voices and courageous leaders in the cause of justice for all people. Bishops are also <br /> authorized to appoint ordained clergy to their responsibilities, consecrate, ordain, and commission persons in ministry to the Church and world.</strike>&nbsp; <b>bishops are authorized to guard the faith, order, liturgy, doctrine, and discipline of the Church. The role and calling forth of the bishop, is to exercise oversight and support of the Church in its mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The basis of such discipleship of leadership (<i>episkop&#233;</i>) lies in discipline and a disciplined life.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop leads therefore through the following disciplines:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) A vital and renewing spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the bishop is to faithfully practice, model and lead the spiritual disciplines of our faith and to call and inspire the clergy and laity within the Church to practice the Christian disciplines in their individual lives through the tradition of personal holiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop is to lead in public worship, in the celebration of the sacraments and in the commendation of our faith.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> b) An enquiring mind and a commitment to the teaching office.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the bishop is to continue to learn and to teach how to make disciples and lead faithful and fruitful congregations using scripture, spiritual disciplines, our Wesleyan heritage, and the history and doctrines of the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> c) A vision for the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of bishop is to lead the whole Church in claiming its mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop leads by discerning, inspiring, strategizing, equipping, implementing, and evaluating the fulfillment of the mission of the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Working in partnership with the Council of Bishops, the cabinet and lay and clergy leadership of the annual conference, and the professing members of the church, the bishop urges the whole church to move toward the vision of sharing Christ with the world in fulfillment of our mission, faithful discipleship and a &ldquo;more excellent way&rdquo; of being Christ&rsquo;s people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> d) A prophetic commitment for the transformation of the Church and the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the bishop is to be a prophetic voice for justice in a suffering and conflicted world through the tradition of social holiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop encourages and models the mission of witness and service in the world through proclamation of the gospel and alleviation of human suffering.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> e) A passion for the unity of the church. The role of the bishop is to be the shepherd of the whole flock and thereby provide leadership toward the goal of understanding, reconciliation and unity within the Church &ndash; the United Methodist Church and the church universal. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f) The ministry of administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;The role of the bishop is to uphold the discipline and order of the Church by consecrating, ordaining, commissioning, supervising and appointing persons in ministry to the Church and the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the presiding officer of the annual conference, the resident bishop provides order and leads in new opportunities for ministry within the annual conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bishop shares with other bishops the oversight of the whole church through the Council of Bishops and is held accountable through the Council of Bishops in collaboration with conference and jurisdictional committees on episcopacy. <br /> </b>2. District superintendents are elders in full connection appointed by the bishop to the cabinet <b>as an extension of the superintending role of the bishop within the annual conference through the same disciplines and in accordance with their responsibilities designated in the <i>Book of Discipline</i> under the supervision of the resident bishop. </b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;and assigned to responsibilities of oversight and supervision within a district and in the entire annual conference (¶ 401). A servant leader who serves as an extension of the oversight of the bishop, the district superintendent is authorized to fulfill those responsibilities designated in the Book of Discipline under the supervision of the resident bishop.</strike>&nbsp; <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This legislation integrates elements from the Guidelines for Superintending in this Age and the Duties of Bishops and Superintendents into a new paragraph on the Role of Bishops and District Superintendents.<br /></p></td>
