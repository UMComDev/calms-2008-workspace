Native American History and Contemporary Culture<br> as Related to Effective Church Participation <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, current literature and research suggest a substantial &ldquo;communication gap&rdquo; between Native Americans and non-Indian United Methodist Church entities, specifically as it relates to non-Indian entities comprehending the concept of Native American life, culture, language, spirit, values, and such; and <br> Whereas, this vague communication has been a consistent problem over history, with minimal effort from non-Indian entities to change their attitudes toward Native Americans until recent trends; and <br> Whereas, such attitude of society reflects a growing trend toward developing and implementing a system accommodating, to a high degree, cultural diversity; generally speaking, society is beginning to demonstrate comprehension of the term <i>multicultural</i> education as related to the year 2000 and is making efforts to become even more informed; services that once perpetuated Eurocentric society only are now examining the values of the ever-growing ethnic populations and attempting to integrate these values into their service activities (education, government, health, business, and such); and <br> Whereas, there are substantial numbers of ethnic professionals capable of providing effective instruction in cultural diversity as related to The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s current and future thrusts; and <br> Whereas, there still is a critical need for The United Methodist Church to become concretely familiar with its Native American membership in order to ensure their religious, denominational, spiritual, and emotional well-being; and <br> Whereas, there is an expressed concern from The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s Native American membership that racism and prejudice are significant contributors to the absence of Native American representation in the church&rsquo;s hierarchy; and <br> Whereas, the formal means of eliminating this condition is through the formal instruction in Native American history, culture, and contemporary affairs of non-Indian entities of The United Methodist Church; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that General Conference advocate the development and implementation of a training policy whereby Native American history, culture, and contemporary affairs will be an integral part of ministry and administrative training for all aspects of The United Methodist Church; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that General Conference designate the National United Methodist Native American Center, Inc., as the center for the research, development, and training components of the requested curriculum; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that General Conference support a policy that the concept of &ldquo;Indian preference&rdquo; be utilized in the selection of instructors and speakers for the proposed training components. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> Readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
