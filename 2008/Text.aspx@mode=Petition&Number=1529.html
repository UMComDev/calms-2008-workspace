It shall meet additionally at the request of the bishop, the district superintendent, the pastor, any other person accountable to the committee, or the chairperson of the committee. <strike>To fulfill his or her obligation under ordination, his or her connectional responsibility under appointment, and his or her duty as a pastor, the pastor should be present at each meeting of the committee on pastor-parish relations or staff-parish relations except where he or she voluntarily excuses himself or herself. The committee shall meet only with the knowledge of the pastor and/or the district superintendent. It may meet with the district superintendent without the pastor being present. However, the pastor or any member of the staff under consideration shall be notified prior to such meeting at which a pastor&rsquo;s or clergy staff member&rsquo;s continued appointment or a lay staff member&rsquo;s employment is discussed and be brought into consultation immediately thereafter. The committee shall meet in closed session, and information shared in the committee shall be confidential.</strike>&nbsp; <b>The committee shall meet only with the knowledge of the pastor and/or the district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastor shall be present at each meeting of the committee on pastor-parish relations or staff-parish relations except where he or she voluntarily excuses himself or herself. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The committee may meet with the district superintendent without the pastor or appointed staff under consideration being present.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the pastor or appointed staff under consideration shall be notified prior to such meeting with the district superintendent and be brought into consultation immediately thereafter. <br /> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall meet in closed session, and information shared in the committee shall be confidential</b>.<br /> <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>With less language, these changes help clarify 1) that a properly convened S/PPR committee meeting without the district superintendent requires the presence of the pastor unless he or she voluntarily excuses herself or himself and 2) that this paragraph focuses upon clergy and staff appointed by the Bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></td>
