Ake Green, was found guilty of violating Sweden&rsquo;s hate-speech law for saying in a sermon that homosexual practice was immoral; and <br /> WHEREAS, the overturning of Green&rsquo;s conviction in 2005 by an appeals court was strongly protested by homosexual rights leaders in that country; and <br /> WHEREAS, in September 2007, New Jersey state government officials took punitive action against the Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association, a United Methodist ministry founded in 1869, because of the Association&rsquo;s refusal to host same-sex union ceremonies; and <br /> WHEREAS, after his nomination to be U.S. Surgeon General, United Methodist Judicial Council President James Holsinger has been strongly denounced by secular homosexual rights groups for his United Methodist faith; and <br /> WHEREAS, such attacks on Dr. Holsinger&rsquo;s nomination imply that anyone who believes in biblical, United Methodist teaching of sexual morality is unfit for public office; and <br /> WHEREAS, the open or at least tacit support of many homosexual rights activists for such discriminatory actions as those noted above suggests that their true agenda is ultimately far less benevolent than their rhetoric of &ldquo;inclusiveness,&rdquo; &ldquo;freedom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;equality&rdquo; indicate; and <br /> WHEREAS, the General Board of Church and Society has not reacted against these threats to religious liberty; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that the 2008 General Conference goes on record as decrying any discrimination against any people for their personal belief in biblical and traditional moral standards and as affirming our solidarity with victims of such mistreatment; and <br /> Be it further resolved, that we urge the General Board of Church and Society to support the victims of such discrimination, through encouragement and advocacy, and <br /> Be it further resolved, that we call on groups opposed to our Church&rsquo;s teaching on homosexual practice to join in opposition to any discrimination against people on the basis of their sharing our Church&rsquo;s position.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /> &nbsp;John Leo, &ldquo;Bombarded by Bans,&rdquo; 13 October 2002, <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>; available from <u>&lt;http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/articles/021021/archive_022976_2.htm&gt; </u>; accessed 26 October 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;Keith B.
