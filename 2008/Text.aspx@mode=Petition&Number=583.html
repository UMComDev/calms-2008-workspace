Even in the United States where there are 268 billionaires, a large percentage of all children live below the poverty line. The richest 1 percent of Americans had as much income in 1999 as the bottom 38 percent combined. In many poor countries in Africa and Asia, the poverty is deeper and the gap between rich and poor exceeds the gap that existed in life between Dives and Lazarus. In such a situation, the church must decide whether its mission to preach good news to the poor is good news only for their spiritual life or whether it is good news to the whole person. From the beginnings of Methodism, we have always been a movement that sees the whole person, body and soul. Wesley's class meetings emphasized both acts of piety and acts of mercy. He organized and used the class meetings to support groups like sewing collectives, that helped those who didn't have much money, bring their resources together to start small businesses that would be a witness to God's abundance in the midst of poverty. The church has many opportunities to continue that witness if we make the commitment that Wesley made: every congregation not only gives to mission, but has an opportunity to use its assets for the building of a more just economy. Drawing on the teachings of Jesus and the prophets, the writings and example of our founder John Wesley, and on an analysis of current economic conditions, we can discern pathways leading to a more just and equitable sharing of the riches which God has given us as a human family. These pathways are personal, local, and global. Personal Pathways to Economic Justice:<br /> <br /> <ul><li> Support locally based businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li><b>Model sustainable living by </b><strike> R<b></strike> r</b>ecycl<b>ing</b><strike> e</strike>&nbsp;waste products and avoid<b>ing the</b> use of disposable products <strike> where possible</strike> .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li> Buy organic, locally produced foods<b> and/or fairly traded goods.</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;as much as possible</strike> .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li> Invest personal savings in stocks and mutual funds which are socially screened.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li> Buy <b>&ldquo;sweat-free&rdquo; </b><strike> only </strike> clothing and other articles <b>rather than those</b><strike> that you know are not </strike> manufactured by child labor, sweatshop, or slave labor.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li> Engage in Bible study on economic justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take part in study groups on economic issues, using materials <strike> from groups like the People of Faith Network.<b></strike> available from general agencies and community-based organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Local Paths to Economic Justice&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </li></li></li><li>Support local initiatives <strike> for <b></strike> to ensure availability of&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>moderate and low income housing.

The kingdom of God is a form of economy that calls forth from each of us a commitment to the abundance of God in our midst. It is a call to renounce the politics of greed and acquisitiveness which dominate the institutions of government and business and reclaim their true calling in the service of people. Economy is how we order our lives, our politics, our world. It is time that we manifest gospel values in the economic order. It is after all, our calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> </sub><sup><b><sup> 1</sup></sub></sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;World Bank / Forbes 2007 </b><br /> <br /> ADOPTED 2000 See Social Principles, Â¶ 163D and E.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p></td>
