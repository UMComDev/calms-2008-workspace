As agribusiness <br /> has grown and population centers shifted towards urban areas, the intimate <br /> connection between our food, the hands that harvest it, and God&rsquo;s Creation has <br /> been strained. <br /> While The United Methodist Church supports &ldquo;the right of persons and families to <br /> live and prosper as farmers&rdquo; (Social Principles, ¶162.N), society has failed to fully <br /> value the essential contributions of farmers. This growing disconnect, combined <br /> with long-established patterns of racism in the United States, has created a crisis <br /> among African American farmers. <br /> Over the past 100 years, the number of African American farmers in the United <br /> States has shrunk from over 925,000 to less than 18,000 today. The share of <br /> farmland owned by African American farmers likewise has shrunk from roughly 14 <br /> percent to less than 1 percent. <br /> These losses have been accelerated by a lack of access to capital, technical <br /> information and legal resources needed to train and develop agricultural holdings <br /> into stable, income-producing, self-sustaining operations. Although the United <br /> States Department of Agriculture (USDA) is charged with assisting all farmers, a <br /> 1997 Report by the USDA entitled, <i>Civil Rights at the United States Department of <br /> Agriculture</i>, confirmed widespread discrimination within the agency. These <br /> discriminatory practices denied farmers access to loan approval, loan servicing and <br /> farm management assistance. <br /> Despite a landmark class action settlement reached with USDA in 1999 providing a <br /> system of payments for farmers who faced discrimination, the struggle for justice <br /> continues. Many African American farmers were shut out of the settlement process <br /> and thousands of others heard about the settlement only after the deadline for filing <br /> a claim had passed. <br /> In order to ensure justice for all farmers and the preservation of a unique and vital <br /> heritage of rural communities, The United Methodist Church: <br /> 1. Reaffirms its support for a settlement aimed at redressing discriminatory <br /> practices by USDA; <br /> 2. Calls on USDA to establish a process to re-evaluate pending claims by <br /> African American farmers based on the merits rather than flawed <br /> bureaucratic deadlines; <br /> 3. Calls on USDA to establish and enforce strict guidelines on agency <br /> outreach and action to guard against further discrimination; <br /> 4. Calls on the United States Congress to fully fund the Minority Farm <br /> Outreach and Technical Assistance Program; <br /> 5. And, recognizing the critical need for community, government and <br /> private sector collaboration to help stem the decline of African American <br /> farmland, calls on the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries to work with community-based organizations such as the Federation of Southern Cooperatives / Land Assistance Fund to care for the needs of African American farmers in the United States. <br /> Social Principles ¶163 A and N <br /> </b><br /></p></td>
