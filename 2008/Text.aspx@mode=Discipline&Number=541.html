<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>541.</b> <i>Composition</i>-1. The <b>central conference</b> shall be composed of clergy and lay members in equal numbers, the clergy members elected by the clergy members of the annual conference and the lay members by the lay members thereof. Their qualifications and the manner of election shall be determined by the central conference itself, subject only to constitutional requirements. Each annual conference and provisional annual conference shall be entitled to at least two clergy and two lay delegates, and no other selection of delegates shall be authorized that would provide for more than one clergy delegate for every six clergy members of an annual conference; except that a majority of the number fixed by a central conference as the ratio of representation shall entitle an annual conference to an additional clergy delegate and to an additional lay delegate. Each missionary conference and mission is authorized to elect and send one of its members to the central conference concerned as its representative, said representative to be accorded the privilege of sitting with the committees of the central conference, with the right to speak in the committees and in the regular sessions of the central conference, but without the right to vote. Representatives of missionary conferences or missions shall have the same claim for payment of expenses as is allowed to members of the central conference.</sub><sup>10 <br> </sup></sub>2. In the case of a central conference, the rule of proportionate representation shall be applied by each annual conference, and in the case of the delegates to the Central Conference of Central and Southern Europe, the rule shall be applied to delegates coming from the annual conference of Switzerland/France. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 10. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 371. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;
