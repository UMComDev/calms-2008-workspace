This plan is particularly synergistic with the third proposal, &ldquo;partner with the poor to seek justice and address the causes of human suffering that result from poverty,&rdquo; which has been assigned to Global Ministries to take the lead on. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, urban transformation will require a collaborative effort by local churches working in cooperation with other denominations, community organizations, businesses, and governmental institutions; collaboration will need to occur beyond the city limits by collaborating with exurban churches which share similar challenges, and churches in suburban areas which have committed persons, resources and relational roots in urban neighborhoods, all of which strengthen ministry. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, collaboration will also need to occur at the national&nbsp; level with the National Urban Strategy Council and general agency teams (Global Ministries, Church and Society, Discipleship, Higher Education and Ministry, Religion and Race, and Communications) working together to identify common strategies that they can mutually accomplish; the national&nbsp; strategies linking with local strategies and needs; national collaboration involving the ethnic ministry plans already adopted by our Church with a particular sensitivity to those who are poor; and finally, national collaboration involving other ecumenical and inter-faith bodies and national urban resources. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that we call upon the general agencies, the National Urban Strategy Council, jurisdictional networks, annual conferences, districts and especially, local churches to take authority and responsibility in being holy and bold to accomplish the goals and objectives of the plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved, that the General Board of Global Ministries Office of Urban Ministries will be responsible for the coordination and implementation of the plan. Objectives and action steps have been developed and will be implemented as funding is made available. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved, in order to facilitate this coordination and implementation, the Office of Urban Ministries will have copies of the plan available for any who wish to partner in this effort, and that with God&rsquo;s help, we can re-claim our cities for United Methodism and, in the process, meet Christ on the streets walking with his people.</b><br /></p></td>
