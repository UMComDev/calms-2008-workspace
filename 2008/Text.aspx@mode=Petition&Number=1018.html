Independent Inquiry Committee<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the UN has passed resolutions calling for a zero tolerance policy, the fact remains that the UN has taken no substantive steps other than rhetoric to enforce their policy or hold offenders accountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Methodist Church partners with the United Nations in many programs, treaties, and mission projects involving women, children, and youth, and thus has a great moral and practical interest in assuring the integrity of United Nations relief programs. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, The United Methodist Church calls for the end of all abusive acts, sexual and otherwise, against women, children, and youth, in connection with United Nations humanitarian aid programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;We insist that the United Nations enforce a zero tolerance policy against such abuse. <br /> The United Methodist Church strongly calls upon the United Nations to enforce all existing prohibitions by increasing monitoring programs and by prosecuting all U.N. officials and NGO workers who are found guilty of exploiting and sexually abusing women, children, and youth.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call upon the United Nations to overhaul all of the U.N. bureaucracy that allows this abuse and exploitation to continue and to go unpunished.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> </b><br /></p></td>
