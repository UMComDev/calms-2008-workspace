<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>314. United Methodists Sharing the Vulnerability<br> in the Process of Alteration <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Paul reminded the divided Corinthians, &ldquo;If one part (of the body) suffers, every part suffers with it; if one part is honored, every part rejoices with it&rdquo; <i>(</i>1 Corinthians 12:25). It is in this spirit that the European community, its peoples and its churches, are gathering together to respond to a time of change and transformation-a time of alteration in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The fall of the Berlin wall (1989) was a symbol of a new political order in Europe. Ever since, Europe has been in a process of alteration which has led to both improvements and new challenges. <br> The United Methodist Church recognizes with gratitude a trend to democratisation and increased freedom in many countries as well as a development towards a larger community of European nations. We affirm that many people, among them numerous Christians, including United Methodists, are now more vigilant in the journey of Europe towards &ldquo;An Area of Freedom, Security and Justice&rdquo; (expression from European Community Law). <br> After September 11, 2001, people all over the world are more than ever experiencing a profound sense of vulnerability. As a people of faith we are recognizing that a shared vulnerabililty may become more important for mutual understanding and caring than privileged security of some. This shared vulnerability has helped to see the European Process of Alteration in the context of an encompassing global transformation which in particular includes the continents of Africa, Asia and Latin America. <br> A decade ago we rejoiced as we experienced great political changes in Central and Eastern Europe. <br> Today it is clear that the magnitude and the content of the problems encountered have been underestimated by governments, the media, the general public as well as the churches. Rising unemployment and the falling value of pensions and wages has plunged millions of people into poverty. United Nations Development Reports for Central and Eastern Europe show that in 1989 about 14 million people in the former communist block lived with less than four dollars a day. By the mid-nineties that number had risen to 147 million people. Only a small minority has participated in economic growth and development. In many places health care, schooling and education standards declined dramatically whilst commerce-based criminality grew rapidly. <br> Given this situation, the United Methodist Minorities in Europe together with the other denominations emphasises the need for human development through witness for Jesus Christ and through working towards justice for the poor and vulnerable like women, children, gypsies and other ethnic minorities. United Methodists are together in mission to safeguard the local initiatives and the dignity of clergy and lay missionaries, women and men, faithfully responding to the calling of Jesus, our Lord and Saviour. We therefore affirm that church-planting, evangelism and social initiatives in Eastern Europe, Russia, the Baltics and the Balkans require continued support by the larger Methodist family, spiritually and financially. Even if local churches may become financially self-sustaining and strong enough to continue the mission among the vulnerable and the poor on their own it should not be forgotten that the Lord&lsquo;s commandment to mission is addressed to the whole Church. <br> We are thankful for the &ldquo;Fund Mission in Europe,&rdquo; a solidarity initiative of the European Methodist Council to collect financial means among Methodist congregations in Western and Northern Europe for newly emerging churches and congregations in the East and in the South. The financial and spiritual support generated by local churches and conferences in the USA during the last ten years was an act of rescuing. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>The Process of European Integration-Hopes and Challenges <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The process of change has been strengthened especially by the European Union which aims to work for peace, stability and welfare. The initiation of an unprecedented enlargement involving 13 new candidate countries is an ambition on a new level and on a new scale. Unfortunately, it has become clear that there is a widening gap between the expectations of tangible results on the one hand and loss of patience resulting from dissatisfaction with the actual process on the other hand. <br> Particular challenges in this context are: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>transparency in the negotiating process; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> free movement of persons / migration; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> human and social costs of the integration process; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> protection of the rights of minorities; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> preservation of indigenous (regional) cultures and identities; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> future borders of the European Union and the relations to the new neighbours; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> commitment to common (Christian) values. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As United Methodists, we affirm that the European integration process is a sign of hope. We support efforts for the creation and development of independent regional cooperation and communities of nations, such as the European Union and the OSCE including USA and Canada. At the same time, we are also aware of the dangers that continue to threaten the process toward a new Europe such as self-serving nationalism, serious economic problems and social upheavel. Against this background, the current priorities of the United Methodist Church&rsquo;s human rights program are as follows: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>protection of refugees, migrants, asylum seekers and displaced people; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> social policy questions in the transformation that nations make into market economics; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> social rights for all, in particular respect and justice for women, children and minorities; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> religious freedom; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> environmental and energy policies for a sustainable way of life. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Churches are not left untouched by the processes of political, economic and cultural integration. The Conference of European Churches, together with the Roman Catholic Council of European Bishops Conferences, the Leuenberg Church Fellowship and the European Methodist Council, are very actively involved in internal and external processes of integration. In particular, the European Churches developed a &ldquo;Charta Oecumenica&rdquo; which is meant to be a helpful tool for dialogue and advocacy for the practical life together of the Orthodox, Protestant, Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. <br> We believe and affirm that the Churches in Europe have a message of hope. The new Europe can not be built without them. The United Methodist Church is not nationally bound and is, therefore, particularly called upon to advance the goal of integration in the present European process of alteration on the way to a true Area of Freedom, Security and Justice. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; <p align="right">Zurich and Budapest, March 5, 2003 <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See,</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
