<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>319. The Philippines <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>We rejoice with the reported release of 15 hostages previously held by extremist Muslim rebels. We share the agony of those twenty-one hostages from Sipadan Island in Malaysia, among them French, German, Lebanese, South African, Finnish, and Malaysian nationals who face continuing uncertainties. We condemn the outbreak of violent conflict involving the rebels and the Philippine government in fourteen localities in Mindanao, including those in Sulo and Basilan Islands. <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> the 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church express its prayer: that hostilities immediately cease; that food, medicines, clothing, and safe refuge be insured by all parties to those whose lives are in their hands; and that humanitarian agencies be allowed to care for them until ultimate return of peace in their lands; that we join all who desire a solution of the conflicts and the struggles that will build a just and durable peace; that we call upon all peoples to recognize one another to be in community with each other in the hope of a just world order, upholding how all persons and groups must feel secure in their life and right to live within society if order is to be achieved and maintained by law; and that we especially express this hope to both Christian and non-Christian alike, who live the rigors of southern Philippines community. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165<i>D</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
