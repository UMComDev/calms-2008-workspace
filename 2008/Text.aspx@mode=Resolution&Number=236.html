<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>236. Rights of Farm Workers in the U.S. <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>As we embark on a new century, the gap between the wealthy and poor in the United States continues to widen. The church is called to take an active role in advocating for social justice. <br> Farm workers are essential to the economic well-being of U.S. society, but they continue to live and work under conditions which deprive them of what is decent and adequate to survive. They are among the poorest paid workers in this country and have struggled to be included under the minimum wage laws. The wages they receive (an average annual income of $8000) result in farm workers and their families living in conditions of poverty. At their workplace and in communities in which they live, they face discrimination and exploitation based on ethnicity, country of origin, socioeconomic status, immigrant status, and educational level. U.S. national labor laws exclude farm workers from their protection. Intentional exclusion from these protections denies farm workers such rights as overtime pay or the protected right to organize. The few state and federal laws established to protect farm worker rights, such as the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act, have not been adequately enforced. Instead these laws have continued to be weakened at every level. This places farm workers and their families in jeopardy of abuse, serious injury, and even death. In addition, unemployment and workers&rsquo; compensation benefits have been systematically denied to farm workers. Farm labor policies, such as the current guestworker/H2A visa program which allows agricultural workers temporary entrance into the U.S., have severely diminished the limited protections afforded farm workers. This type of program keeps real wages down; maintains substandard working conditions; eliminates workers&rsquo; rights to voice grievances; and denies workers their civil rights, including the fundamental right of freedom of movement. Farm work is one of the most hazardous occupations in the United States, placing workers at a higher risk of injury. Farm workers and their families exhibit a variety of severe health problems at a rate well above the national average. Health insurance benefits for most workers are nonexistent and access to adequate health care services is extremely limited. They cope with both a lack of toilets and drinking water in the fields, and daily exposure to pesticides. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that as many as 300,000 farm workers are poisoned each year by pesticides. They suffer the highest rate of chemically-related illness of any occupational group. Farm workers&rsquo; ability to protect themselves from pesticide poisoning is minimized by their lack of access to the necessary information, and the fear of retaliation for filing complaints when violations occur. The agricultural industry continually attempts to dilute the law and render it useless. <br> Children of farm workers are often forced by their parents&rsquo; poverty into the fields at ages as young as 10. Educational systems have almost universally failed to provide for their needs, resulting in extremely high dropout rates of farm worker children and perpetuating the poverty of farm worker families. Immigration and welfare reform laws attempted to exclude many farm worker children from access to education. <br> In a 1994 report entitled &ldquo;Farmworker Women Speak Out,&rdquo; the Farmworker Justice Fund found that:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 1. farm worker women do nearly every kind of farm labor on every kind of farm; <br> 2. they routinely receive less pay than men for the same work;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. employers frequently attribute and give women&rsquo;s earnings to the male head of the household as a way of meeting federal or state minimum wage requirements; <br> 4. they are subjected to sexual harassment, assault, and rape by crew leaders and male farm workers (Crew leaders are paid by growers to recruit, transport, house, and supervise farm workers); and <br> 5. crew leaders often demand sexual favors in return for giving them places on work crews-and on the buses that take them to the fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We Christians are called to be in solidarity with the least of these our brothers and sisters (Matthew 25). In response to the plight of farm workers and their families, The United Methodist Church: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>publicly denounces any and all mistreatment of farm workers and strongly demands that the employers treat farm workers and their families with dignity and respect; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> commits itself to work in cooperation with the National Farm Worker Ministry and community-based farm worker organizations, whose primary mission is promoting the self-organization and self-determination of farm workers; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> calls on the General Board of Church and Society, the General Board of Global Ministries, and annual conferences to support state and federal legislation that would strengthen the laws protecting farm workers&rsquo; rights and provide the funding necessary for adequate enforcement of the laws; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> urges the United Methodist Committee on Relief to especially consider the needs of farm workers when administering relief efforts;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> urges annual conferences, especially where farm workers live and work, to monitor situations where farm workers have won union elections but have not been able to negotiate effective collective agreements and to use their personal and institutional resources to encourage bargaining in good faith; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> urges local churches to consider a farm worker Sabbath as a day of study, prayer, and action, including legislative advocacy, and to develop ministries of mercy and justice to and with farm workers in cooperation with community organizations, government agencies, and labor unions. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>H. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
