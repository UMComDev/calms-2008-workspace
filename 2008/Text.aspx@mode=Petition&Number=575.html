Usually held two weekends before Thanksgiving, this national event is an expression of our Christian gratitude for the gift of life. Congregations may choose a variety of ways to educate persons about organ and tissue donation. Examples of ways churches currently participate include developing special liturgies, bulletin inserts, sermons on the subject and church school discussions. Additional examples may be found on the internet at http://www.organdonor.gov/natldonorsabbath.htm and on the web sites of United Methodist and other faith groups and general agencies. Waiting lists for organ and tissue transplants are long and the need is great. National Donor Sabbath provides yet another way United Methodists can help save lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></td>
