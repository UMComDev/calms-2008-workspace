<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b><i>Part II <br> </b></b><b></i></i></b></i>DOCTRINAL STANDARDS AND OUR THEOLOGICAL TASK</sub><sup>1</sup></sub><br> <b>¶&nbsp;101. SECTION 1-OUR DOCTRINAL HERITAGE <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>United Methodists profess the historic Christian faith in God, incarnate in Jesus Christ for our salvation and ever at work in human history in the Holy Spirit. Living in a covenant of grace under the Lordship of Jesus Christ, we participate in the first fruits of God&rsquo;s coming reign and pray in hope for its full realization on earth as in heaven. <br> Our heritage in doctrine and our present theological task focus upon a renewed grasp of the sovereignty of God and of God&rsquo;s love in Christ amid the continuing crises of human existence. <br> Our forebears in the faith reaffirmed the ancient Christian message as found in the apostolic witness even as they applied it anew in their own circumstances. <br> Their preaching and teaching were grounded in Scripture, informed by Christian tradition, enlivened in experience, and tested by reason. <br> Their labors inspire and inform our attempts to convey the saving gospel to our world with its needs and aspirations. <br> <b>Our Common Heritage as Christians <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>United Methodists share a common heritage with Christians of every age and nation. This heritage is grounded in the apostolic witness <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with diverse interpretations of the apostolic message, leaders of the early church sought to specify the core of Christian belief in order to ensure the soundness of Christian teaching. <br> The determination of the canon of Christian Scripture and the adoption of ecumenical creeds such as the formulations of Nicaea and Chalcedon were of central importance to this consensual process. Such creeds helped preserve the integrity of the church&rsquo;s witness, set boundaries for acceptable Christian doctrine, and proclaimed the basic elements of the enduring Christian message. These statements of faith, along with the Apostles&rsquo; Creed, contain the most prominent features of our ecumenical heritage. <br> The Protestant reformers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries devised new confessional statements that reiterated classical Christian teaching in an attempt to recover the authentic biblical witness. These documents affirmed the primacy of Scripture and provided formal doctrinal standards through their statements of essential beliefs on matters such as the way of salvation, the Christian life, and the nature of the church. <br> Many distinctively Protestant teachings were transmitted into United Methodist understandings through doctrinal formulations such as the Articles of Religion of the Church of England and the Heidelberg Catechism of the Reformed tradition. <br> Various doctrinal statements in the form of creeds, confessions of belief, and articles of faith were officially adopted by churches as standards of Christian teaching. Notwithstanding their importance, these formal doctrinal standards by no means exhausted authoritative Christian teaching. <br> The standards themselves initially emerged from a much wider body of Christian thought and practice, and their fuller significance unfolded in the writings of the church&rsquo;s teachers. Some writings have proved simply to be dated benchmarks in the story of the church&rsquo;s continuing maturation. <br> By contrast, some sermons, treatises, liturgies, and hymns have gained considerable practical authority in the life and thought of the church by virtue of their wide and continuing acceptance as faithful expositions of Christian teaching. Nonetheless, the basic measure of authenticity in doctrinal standards, whether formally established or received by tradition, has been their fidelity to the apostolic faith grounded in Scripture and evidenced in the life of the church through the centuries. <br> <b>Basic Christian Affirmations <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>With Christians of other communions we confess belief in the triune God-Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. This confession embraces the biblical witness to God&rsquo;s activity in creation, encompasses God&rsquo;s gracious self-involvement in the dramas of history, and anticipates the consummation of God&rsquo;s reign. <br> The created order is designed for the well-being of all creatures and as the place of human dwelling in covenant with God. As sinful creatures, however, we have broken that covenant, become estranged from God, wounded ourselves and one another, and wreaked havoc throughout the natural order. We stand in need of redemption. <br> <b>We hold in common with all Christians a faith in the mystery of salvation in and through Jesus Christ.</b> At the heart of the gospel of salvation is God&rsquo;s incarnation in Jesus of Nazareth. Scripture witnesses to the redeeming love of God in Jesus&rsquo; life and teachings, his atoning death, his resurrection, his sovereign presence in history, his triumph over the powers of evil and death, and his promised return. Because God truly loves us in spite of our willful sin, God judges us, summons us to repentance, pardons us, receives us by that grace given to us in Jesus Christ, and gives us hope of life eternal. <br> <b>We share the Christian belief that God&rsquo;s redemptive love is realized in human life by the activity of the Holy Spirit, both in personal experience and in the community of believers. </b>This community is the church, which the Spirit has brought into existence for the healing of the nations. <br> Through faith in Jesus Christ we are forgiven, reconciled to God, and transformed as people of the new covenant. <br> &ldquo;Life in the Spirit&rdquo; involves diligent use of the means of grace such as praying, fasting, attending upon the sacraments, and inward searching in solitude. It also encompasses the communal life of the church in worship, mission, evangelism, service, and social witness. <br> <b>We understand ourselves to be part of Christ&rsquo;s universal church when by adoration, proclamation, and service we become conformed to Christ.</b> We are initiated and incorporated into this community of faith by Baptism, receiving the promise of the Spirit that re-creates and transforms us. Through the regular celebration of Holy Communion, we participate in the risen presence of Jesus Christ and are thereby nourished for faithful discipleship. <br> We pray and work for the coming of God&rsquo;s realm and reign to the world and rejoice in the promise of everlasting life that overcomes death and the forces of evil. <br> <b>With other Christians we recognize that the reign of God is both a present and future reality.</b> The church is called to be that place where the first signs of the reign of God are identified and acknowledged in the world. Wherever persons are being made new creatures in Christ, wherever the insights and resources of the gospel are brought to bear on the life of the world, God&rsquo;s reign is already effective in its healing and renewing power. <br> We also look to the end time in which God&rsquo;s work will be fulfilled. This prospect gives us hope in our present actions as individuals and as the Church. This expectation saves us from resignation and motivates our continuing witness and service. <br> <b>We share with many Christian communions a recognition of the authority of Scripture in matters of faith, the confession that our justification as sinners is by grace through faith, and the sober realization that the church is in need of continual reformation and renewal.</b><br> We affirm the general ministry of all baptized Christians who share responsibility for building up the church and reaching out in mission and service to the world. <br> With other Christians, we declare the essential oneness of the church in Christ Jesus. This rich heritage of shared Christian belief finds expression in our hymnody and liturgies. Our unity is affirmed in the historic creeds as we confess one holy, catholic, and apostolic church. It is also experienced in joint ventures of ministry and in various forms of ecumenical cooperation. <br> Nourished by common roots of this shared Christian heritage, the branches of Christ&rsquo;s church have developed diverse traditions that enlarge our store of shared understandings. Our avowed ecumenical commitment as United Methodists is to gather our own doctrinal emphases into the larger Christian unity, there to be made more meaningful in a richer whole. <br> If we are to offer our best gifts to the common Christian treasury, we must make a deliberate effort as a church to strive for critical self-understanding. It is as Christians involved in ecumenical partnership that we embrace and examine our distinctive heritage. <br> <b>Our Distinctive Heritage as United Methodists <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The underlying energy of the Wesleyan theological heritage stems from an emphasis upon practical divinity, the implementation of genuine Christianity in the lives of believers. <br> Methodism did not arise in response to a specific doctrinal dispute, though there was no lack of theological controversy. Early Methodists claimed to preach the scriptural doctrines of the Church of England as contained in the Articles of Religion, the Homilies, and the <i>Book of Common Prayer</i>. <br> Their task was not to reformulate doctrine. Their tasks were to summon people to experience the justifying and sanctifying grace of God and encourage people to grow in the knowledge and love of God through the personal and corporate disciplines of the Christian life. <br> The thrust of the Wesleyan movement and of the United Brethren and Evangelical Association was &ldquo;to reform the nation, particularly the Church, and to spread scriptural holiness over the land.&rdquo;<br> Wesley&rsquo;s orientation toward the practical is evident in his focus upon the &ldquo;scripture way of salvation.&rdquo; He considered doctrinal matters primarily in terms of their significance for Christian discipleship. <br> The Wesleyan emphasis upon the Christian life-faith and love put into practice-has been the hallmark of those traditions now incorporated into The United Methodist Church. The distinctive shape of the Wesleyan theological heritage can be seen in a constellation of doctrinal emphases that display the creating, redeeming, and sanctifying activity of God. <br> <b>Distinctive Wesleyan Emphases <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Although Wesley shared with many other Christians a belief in grace, justification, assurance, and sanctification, he combined them in a powerful manner to create distinctive emphases for living the full Christian life. The Evangelical United Brethren tradition, particularly as expressed by Phillip William Otterbein from a Reformed background, gave similar distinctive emphases. <br> Grace pervades our understanding of Christian faith and life. By grace we mean the undeserved, unmerited, and loving action of God in human existence through the ever-present Holy Spirit. While the grace of God is undivided, it precedes salvation as &ldquo;prevenient grace,&rdquo; continues in &ldquo;justifying grace,&rdquo; and is brought to fruition in &ldquo;sanctifying grace.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> We assert that God&rsquo;s grace is manifest in all creation even though suffering, violence, and evil are everywhere present. The goodness of creation is fulfilled in human beings, who are called to covenant partnership with God. God has endowed us with dignity and freedom and has summoned us to responsibility for our lives and the life of the world. <br> In God&rsquo;s self-revelation, Jesus Christ, we see the splendor of our true humanity. Even our sin, with its destructive consequences for all creation, does not alter God&rsquo;s intention for us-holiness and happiness of heart. Nor does it diminish our accountability for the way we live. <br> Despite our brokenness, we remain creatures brought into being by a just and merciful God. The restoration of God&rsquo;s image in our lives requires divine grace to renew our fallen nature. <br> <b>Prevenient Grace</b>-We acknowledge God&rsquo;s prevenient grace, the divine love that surrounds all humanity and precedes any and all of our conscious impulses. This grace prompts our first wish to please God, our first glimmer of understanding concerning God&rsquo;s will, and our &ldquo;first slight transient conviction&rdquo; of having sinned against God. <br> God&rsquo;s grace also awakens in us an earnest longing for deliverance from sin and death and moves us toward repentance and faith. <br> <b>Justification and Assurance</b>-We believe God reaches out to the repentant believer in justifying grace with accepting and pardoning love. Wesleyan theology stresses that a decisive change in the human heart can and does occur under the prompting of grace and the guidance of the Holy Spirit. <br> In justification we are, through faith, forgiven our sin and restored to God&rsquo;s favor. This righting of relationships by God through Christ calls forth our faith and trust as we experience regeneration, by which we are made new creatures in Christ. <br> This process of justification and new birth is often referred to as conversion. Such a change may be sudden and dramatic, or gradual and cumulative. It marks a new beginning, yet it is part of an ongoing process. Christian experience as personal transformation always expresses itself as faith working by love. <br> Our Wesleyan theology also embraces the scriptural promise that we can expect to receive assurance of our present salvation as the Spirit &ldquo;bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.&rdquo;<br> <b>Sanctification and Perfection</b>-We hold that the wonder of God&rsquo;s acceptance and pardon does not end God&rsquo;s saving work, which continues to nurture our growth in grace. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, we are enabled to increase in the knowledge and love of God and in love for our neighbor. <br> New birth is the first step in this process of sanctification. Sanctifying grace draws us toward the gift of Christian perfection, which Wesley described as a heart &ldquo;habitually filled with the love of God and neighbor&rdquo; and as &ldquo;having the mind of Christ and walking as he walked.&rdquo;<br> This gracious gift of God&rsquo;s power and love, the hope and expectation of the faithful, is neither warranted by our efforts nor limited by our frailties. <br> <b>Faith and Good Works</b>-We see God&rsquo;s grace and human activity working together in the relationship of faith and good works. God&rsquo;s grace calls forth human response and discipline. <br> Faith is the only response essential for salvation. However, the General Rules remind us that salvation evidences itself in good works. For Wesley, even repentance should be accompanied by &ldquo;fruits meet for repentance,&rdquo; or works of piety and mercy. <br> Both faith and good works belong within an all-encompassing theology of grace, since they stem from God&rsquo;s gracious love &ldquo;shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;<br> <b>Mission and Service</b>-We insist that personal salvation always involves Christian mission and service to the world. By joining heart and hand, we assert that personal religion, evangelical witness, and Christian social action are reciprocal and mutually reinforcing. <br> Scriptural holiness entails more than personal piety; love of God is always linked with love of neighbor, a passion for justice and renewal in the life of the world. <br> The General Rules represent one traditional expression of the intrinsic relationship between Christian life and thought as understood within the Wesleyan tradition. Theology is the servant of piety, which in turn is the ground of social conscience and the impetus for social action and global interaction, always in the empowering context of the reign of God. <br> <b>Nurture and Mission of the Church</b>-Finally, we emphasize the nurturing and serving function of Christian fellowship in the Church. The personal experience of faith is nourished by the worshiping community. <br> For Wesley there is no religion but social religion, no holiness but social holiness. The communal forms of faith in the Wesleyan tradition not only promote personal growth; they also equip and mobilize us for mission and service to the world. <br> The outreach of the church springs from the working of the Spirit. As United Methodists, we respond to that working through a connectional polity based upon mutual responsiveness and accountability. Connectional ties bind us together in faith and service in our global witness, enabling faith to become active in love and intensifying our desire for peace and justice in the world. <br> <b>Doctrine and Discipline in the Christian Life <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>No motif in the Wesleyan tradition has been more constant than the link between Christian doctrine and Christian living. Methodists have always been strictly enjoined to maintain the unity of faith and good works through the means of grace, as seen in John Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Nature, Design, and General Rules of the United Societies</i> (1743). The coherence of faith with ministries of love forms the discipline of Wesleyan spirituality and Christian discipleship. <br> The General Rules were originally designed for members of Methodist societies who participated in the sacramental life of the Church of England. The terms of membership in these societies were simple: &ldquo;a desire to flee from the wrath to come and to be saved from their sins.&rdquo;<br> Wesley insisted, however, that evangelical faith should manifest itself in evangelical living. He spelled out this expectation in the three-part formula of the Rules: <br> &ldquo;It is therefore expected of all who continue therein that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, <br> &ldquo;First: By doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind . . . ; <br> &ldquo;Secondly: By . . . doing good of every possible sort, and, as far as possible, to all . . . ; <br> &ldquo;Thirdly: By attending upon all the ordinances of God&rdquo; (<i>see</i> ¶&nbsp;103). <br> Wesley&rsquo;s illustrative cases under each of these three rules show how the Christian conscience might move from general principles to specific actions. Their explicit combination highlights the spiritual spring of moral action. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Wesley rejected undue reliance upon these rules. Discipline was not church law; it was a way of discipleship. Wesley insisted that true religion is &ldquo;the knowledge of God in Christ Jesus,&rdquo; &ldquo;the life which is hid with Christ in God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the righteousness that [the true believer] thirsts after.&rdquo;<br> <b>General Rules and Social Principles <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Upon such evangelical premises, Methodists in every age have sought to exercise their responsibility for the moral and spiritual quality of society. In asserting the connection between doctrine and ethics, the General Rules provide an early signal of Methodist social consciousness. <br> The Social Principles (¶¶&nbsp;160-166) provide our most recent official summary of stated convictions that seek to apply the Christian vision of righteousness to social, economic, and political issues. Our historic opposition to evils such as smuggling, inhumane prison conditions, slavery, drunkenness, and child labor was founded upon a vivid sense of God&rsquo;s wrath against human injustice and wastage. <br> Our struggles for human dignity and social reform have been a response to God&rsquo;s demand for love, mercy, and justice in the light of the Kingdom. We proclaim no <i>personal gospel</i> that fails to express itself in relevant social concerns; we proclaim no<i> social gospel</i> that does not include the personal transformation of sinners. <br> It is our conviction that the good news of the Kingdom must judge, redeem, and reform the sinful social structures of our time. <br> <i>The Book of Discipline</i> and the General Rules convey the expectation of discipline within the experience of individuals and the life of the Church. Such discipline assumes accountability to the community of faith by those who claim that community&rsquo;s support. <br> Support without accountability promotes moral weakness; accountability without support is a form of cruelty. <br> A church that rushes to punishment is not open to God&rsquo;s mercy, but a church lacking the courage to act decisively on personal and social issues loses its claim to moral authority. The church exercises its discipline as a community through which God continues to &ldquo;reconcile the world to himself.&rdquo;<br> <b>Conclusion <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>These distinctive emphases of United Methodists provide the basis for &ldquo;practical divinity,&rdquo; the experiential realization of the gospel of Jesus Christ in the lives of Christian people. These emphases have been preserved not so much through formal doctrinal declarations as through the vital movement of faith and practice as seen in converted lives and within the disciplined life of the Church. <br> Devising formal definitions of doctrine has been less pressing for United Methodists than summoning people to faith and nurturing them in the knowledge and love of God. The core of Wesleyan doctrine that informed our past rightly belongs to our common heritage as Christians and remains a prime component within our continuing theological task. <br> 1. The Judicial Council ruled in 1972 that all sections of Part II except ¶&nbsp;103 were &ldquo;legislative enactments and neither part of the Constitution nor under the Restrictive Rules&rdquo; (see Judicial Council Decision 358). <br> to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord, which is the source and measure of all valid Christian teaching. <br>
