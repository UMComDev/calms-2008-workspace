The Natural World, remind us that &ldquo;all creation is the Lord&rsquo;s and we are responsible for the ways in which we use and abuse it;&rdquo; and <br /> WHEREAS energy issues are addressed in the 2004 Book of Resolutions: 5. Energy Policy Statement (adopted 1980, amended and readopted 2000); 6. U.S. Energy Policy and United Methodist Responsibility (adopted 2004); and 7. Environmental Justice for a Sustainable Future (adopted 1992, amended and readopted 2004); and <br /> WHEREAS those resolutions recognize the threat to the planet of human activity, the linkage of climate change and energy policy, the imperative need to reduce carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere, and the concern for justice in creating a new energy policy; and <br /> WHEREAS the use of coal, the least expensive means of generating electricity, will increase in the USA and around the world in years to come despite the fact that coal-fired power plants currently are the greatest source of carbon emissions into the atmosphere; and <br /> WHEREAS while the United States will not be the major contributor of carbon monoxide emissions from coal-fired power plants, it is appropriate, if not absolutely essential, that we lead a global effort to quickly and dramatically reduce those emissions; and <br /> WHEREAS appropriate grants and subsidies have helped to create low carbon emission technologies and development of alternative means of generating power, but these approaches have not been employed widely due to the lack of meaningful economic incentives; and <br /> WHEREAS there is a strong and growing conviction within the expert community that a tax on carbon dioxide emissions is the most efficient, if not the only way, to quickly bring about a reduction in these life-threatening emissions into the atmosphere, <br /> THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that The United Methodist Church, recognizing that humankind has but a small window of time to deal with climate change, calls for an urgent national priority to be the establishment of an energy policy that will reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere; and <br /> BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the cornerstone of this new energy policy be the imposition of a carbon emissions tax on power generation enterprises that will: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>§&nbsp;<b>Provide incentives for utilization of carbon capture and storage technology in coal-fired power generation. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;§&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Replace the system of grants and subsidies currently in use. <br /> </b>§&nbsp;<b>Result in energy price levels that invite expansion of alternate energy sources.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>§&nbsp;<b>Reduce the uncertainty in energy costs. <br /> </b>§&nbsp;<b>Provide appropriate relief from other forms of taxation. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AND BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that such a tax: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>§&nbsp;<b>Be implemented over time so that the economy and the public can adjust. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;§&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Be a shift from other taxes so that the system, essentially, is revenue neutral. <br /> </b>§&nbsp;<b>Will not unfairly increase the financial burden on the poor, the elderly, or any other group, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See Social Principles, ¶160.I.
