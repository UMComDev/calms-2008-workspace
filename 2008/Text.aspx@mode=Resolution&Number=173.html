<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>173. Affirmation of Rural Chaplains <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the General Conference since 1996 has affirmed the ministries of rural chaplains and the Rural Chaplains Association, and called on The United Methodist Church to pursue rural chaplaincy as a significant means of enabling renewal in towns/villages and rural churches and communities throughout the world; and, <br> Whereas, the Rural Chaplains Association now has 214 members (women, men, laity and clergy, United Methodist and ecumenical), including several persons from the international community; and, <br> Whereas, rural chaplains are lay and clergy persons who have sensed the call to live in, work with, and advocate for town and rural persons, families, congregations, and communities; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, special emphasis is placed on responses to hate and violence, and advocacy for justice issues among all people, regardless of ethnicity, gender, age, or economic status; and, <br> Whereas, rural chaplains meet annually for support, encouragement, resourcing, and enrichment by means of workshops/consultations which explore biblical understandings and focus on person-related chaplaincy-type skills as well as understanding issues of food production and multi-national economics that impact family farmers, farm workers, migrants, and rural businesses and communities; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, rural chaplains work with other prophetic persons/<br> groups on the local level who are committed to long-term involvement aimed at developing local and outside resources to enhance the lives of rural congregations and communities; and, <br> &nbsp; Whereas, the Rural Chaplains Association greatly empowers the development of lay leadership, serves as one way of recognizing the gifts and graces of rural peoples, and unleashes new possibilities for God&rsquo;s Spirit to move across the countryside; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, rural chaplains will be an asset in the implementation of the National Comprehensive Plan for Town and Country Ministry approved by General Conference of 2000; and, <br> Whereas, the Rural Chaplains Association continues to develop international/global linkages, especially with Russia, Tadjikistan, and Guatemala, by exposing participants to the cultural, economic, political, ecological and religious life of their people;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that rural chaplains continue being recognized as a special type of mission personnel of the General Board of Global Ministries for town and rural settings; and, <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> The United Methodist Church commend and reaffirm its commitment to rural chaplains as the Rural Chaplains Association increases its work nationally, internationally, and ecumenically with lay and clergy persons, many of whom carry out their ministries under trying conditions and in difficult places; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Board of Global Ministries be encouraged to continue support of the Rural Chaplains Association in the future. <br> <p align="right"><b>Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>N</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
