WHEN NOT SET FORTH IN THAT SECTION, CAPITALIZED TERMS HAVE THE MEANINGS SET FORTH IN PREDECESSOR PLANS OR THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO THEM IN THE DISCIPLINE OR A DICTIONARY OF GENERAL USAGE.<b><br />1.2</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>History.</b> Although the Plan bears a different name, it is an amendment and restatement of RSP (as further described in Supplements One and Two). The Plan was effective on the Effective Date, as approved by General Conference 2008. General Conference authorized the establishment of the original predecessor of the Plan, USPF, effective January 1, 1974. USPF was a defined benefit plan that was partially frozen and merged into SPP, effective January 1, 1985, at the direction of General Conference. SPP was a defined contribution plan that preserved USPF as supplement one to SPP. Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP, and participants with a USPF benefit were given the option of retaining benefits measured by one of two defined benefit formulas or converting their defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Those participants who retained the USPF defined benefit accrued benefit were covered in supplement one to SRBP and later supplement one to RSP. USPF benefits are now covered by Supplement One to this Plan. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to move participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan, later succeeded by UMPIP), leaving only General Agency contributions in SRBP and successor plans. Effective January 1, 2007, as approved by General Conference 2004, SRBP was amended and restated as RSP. SRBP was frozen as of December 31, 2006, and participant accounts were transferred to RSP participant accounts. These RSP participant accounts were transferred to Accounts in the Plan as of the Effective Date as provided in Supplement Two. <br /> <b>1.3</b><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b></i>The Plan.</b> The Plan, as approved by General Conference 2008 and as applied to any Plan Sponsor, consists of the following subdivisions, plus any others that may be added to the Plan (and minus any subdivisions that may be removed from the Plan) from time to time: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Active Plan; <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement One, also known as USPF and formerly known as supplement one to RSP; <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplement Two, also known as RSP; and <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Adoption Agreement for that Plan Sponsor. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Plan applies to an Employee, a Participant, a Terminated Participant, a Beneficiary, a Contingent Annuitant, a Recipient, or an Accountholder as of the earlier of the date such person first became eligible for the Plan or first had a benefit, an Accrued Benefit, or an Account and remains applicable, as the Plan exists from time to time, until such person no longer has a benefit, an Accrued Benefit, or an Account under the Plan. If any issue under the Plan arises or applies after such person&rsquo;s benefit or Accrued Benefit has been completely paid or Account has been completely distributed, then the terms of the Plan as they existed on the date of such final payment or distribution will apply to such person. In the case of an Employee, a Beneficiary, or any other person who does not have a benefit, an Accrued Benefit, or an Account according to Plan records, but who claims a benefit under the Plan, the terms of the Plan as they existed at the time or times such person would have been entitled to a benefit, an Accrued Benefit, or an Account if such claim were upheld will govern. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.4</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Plan Subdivisions.</b><br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Subplans</i>. For the purpose of the nomenclature of the Plan, there are four subplans within the Plan: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Active Plan; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF, which is composed of Supplement One, applicable provisions of Sections 1, 2, 10, 11, and 12 of the Active Plan, Supplement Two (to the extent necessary to participate in the Consolidated DB Plan), and any Adoption Agreement executed by a USPF Plan Sponsor (although USPF Plan Sponsors were not required to execute an Adoption Agreement to be USPF Plan Sponsors); <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan, which is composed of applicable portions of Supplement Two, applicable provisions of Sections 1, 2, 10, 11, and 12 of the Active Plan, and applicable provisions of the Adoption Agreement for any Plan Sponsor; and <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan, but only until its assets have been transferred to the Active Plan, at which point it will cease to exist as a separate subplan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Separate Funding</i>. For the purpose of separate funding, there are three subplans within the Plan: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Consolidated DB Plan; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Active Plan; and <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan, but only before its assets have been transferred to the Active Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The assets for each of these three plans will be separately accounted for in the Trust, whether or not they are commingled or transferred, except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan (such as in Supplement Two). Assets from one of these plans will not be used to fund another of these plans (except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan). Each of these three subplans will be treated as a separate single plan for funding purposes within the meaning of Regulation §1.414(l)-1(b)(1). Separate accounting in USPF for certain purposes described in Supplement One will not prevent USPF assets from being available to pay Core DB Plan benefits and vice versa if necessary. Further, separate accounting for the RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan will not prevent the merger of that funding with the Active Plan as provided in Supplement Two. Within each subplan there may be further separate accounting by Plan Sponsor, and asset commingling among Plan Sponsors may be permitted and limited as otherwise provided in the Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Frozen Benefits</i>. USPF and the RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan are frozen as to further Service, but benefits accrued by: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF Participants may be increased in accordance with increases in their USPF Compensation and the Consumer Price Index as provided in Supplement One; and <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan Participants may be increased in accordance with increases in their Compensation and any Annual Benefit Increases applicable to their monthly benefits as provided in Supplement Two. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further Contributions under the RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan are frozen as of the Effective Date (except as otherwise provided in Supplement Two). RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan Account Balances for each Participant are transferred from Supplement Two to the Participant&rsquo;s Active Plan Account Balance as further described in Supplement Two. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type of Plan.</b> The Plan is intended to be a program of one or more church-sponsored retirement income accounts within the meaning of Code §403(b)(9), with the Consolidated DB Plan being a defined benefit plan, as that term is defined in Code §414(j), and the plans listed in Sections 1.4(b)(ii) and (iii) being defined contribution plans, as that term is defined in Code §414(i). The Consolidated DB Plan is a grandfathered pre-August 14, 1982 defined benefit Code §403(b) plan under Code §403(b)(9) in accordance with §251(e)(5) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982. For the purpose of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Number 158, the Consolidated DB Plan is a multi-employer plan. For the purposes of Code §§401(a)(4) and 403(b)(12), the Plan is intended to be a multiple employer plan involving more than one Plan Sponsor. Plan Sponsors may or may not be Affiliates of one another. For the purpose of Code §414(e), the Plan Sponsors are each intended to be a church, a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code §414(e)(3)(C)), or an organization controlled by or associated with a church or a convention or association of churches (within the meaning of Code §414(e)(3)(D). Accordingly, the Plan Sponsors are intended to be one employer solely for the purpose of Code §414(e) (and separate employers for other purposes, except as may otherwise be specifically provided in the Plan). Further, the Plan is intended to meet the requirements of a &ldquo;church plan&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code §414(e) and ERISA §3(33) and to be exempt from ERISA as a Church Plan (that has not made a Code §410(d)(1) election) to the extent permitted under applicable ERISA sections (including, but not limited to, ERISA §§4(b)(2) and 4021(b)(3)) and any other applicable law. <br /> <b>1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding.</b> Contributions to fund the benefits provided under the Plan are made by the Plan Sponsors as provided in the Plan. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>The Trust</i>. To receive such Contributions, the General Board has established the Trust pursuant to the Trust Agreement. All benefits under the Plan will be provided exclusively by distributions from the Trust. The Trustee has the powers and duties specified in the Trust Agreement. The General Board has the authority to replace the Trustee of the Trust at any time, or to establish additional Trusts to fund benefits under the Plan. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Insurance Contracts</i>. Benefits under the Plan may also, at the General Board&rsquo;s discretion, be provided by the purchase of insurance contracts, and, in such event, the term Trust will also include the Plan&rsquo;s interest, if any, in such insurance contracts. Such insurance contracts may be entered into by the General Board or by the Trustee in accordance with the General Board&rsquo;s direction. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Separate Accounts</i>. The Administrator will maintain separate accounting for each of the Regulation §1.414(l)-1(b)(1) subplans identified in Section 1.4(b), for each Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Contributions under each such subplan (subject to Section 1.6(d)), and for each Participant, Beneficiary, or Accountholder under the subplans in Sections 1.4(b)(ii) and (iii). Such accounting will reflect Contributions, Credits, Debits, earnings, losses, forfeitures, transfers, distributions, and any other relevant events necessary to keep accurate accounts. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Defined Benefit Funding.</i> Benefits payable under the Consolidated DB Plan will be funded from the Common Funding Pool in the case of Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors and from the Separate Funding Pool of each Plan Sponsor that is not a Church Funds Agency. On the Effective Date if there are already sufficient assets available from these sources (based on the Funding Policy), no further Contributions to fund the Consolidated DB Plan will be required from any Plan Sponsor. If, at any time, either the Common Funding Pool or any Separate Funding Pool does not have sufficient assets, based on the Funding Policy, then the further provisions of this Section 1.6(d) will apply. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided in Section 1.6(d)(ii), each Plan Sponsor will be responsible to fund its Plan Sponsor Liability to the extent required by the Funding Policy. The funding for each constituent subplan of the Consolidated DB Plan will be accomplished as provided in Supplements One and Two by each Plan Sponsor making Contributions to: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor, the Common Funding Pool; or <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a Plan Sponsor that is not a Church Funds Agency, its Separate Funding Pool; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the extent required by the Funding Policy. Subject to any rules or limitations established by the Plan Administrator: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all assets in the Common Funding Pool are available to pay all benefits attributable to Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors under the Consolidated DB Plan; and <br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all assets in a Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Separate Funding Pool are available to pay all benefits attributable to that Plan Sponsor under the Consolidated DB Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Common Funding Pool does not have or is actuarially projected not to have sufficient assets to pay Consolidated DB Plan Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor Liabilities as they come due, each Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor will be liable to make further Contributions to the Common Funding Pool according to the Funding Policy. If any Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor is not able to or does not make the further Contributions required of it by the Funding Policy, the Administrator will account for any delinquent Contributions (including market rate interest thereon) and will take reasonable steps to attempt to collect the delinquent amounts, including offsetting against any amounts that such delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor may have on deposit with the Administrator. Meanwhile, the Common Funding Pool will pay all benefits of the Consolidated DB Plan attributable to such Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor as they come due. All other Church Funds Agencies will remain obligated to make needed Contributions required by the Funding Policy, which may include a portion of the Contributions due from the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor. But the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor will continue to owe such Contributions to the Common Funding Pool in accordance with the Funding Policy, plus interest on delinquent Contributions at a market rate to be determined by the Administrator from time to time. If the Common Funding Pool does not have sufficient assets, the Administrator is authorized to reduce benefits payable under such Common Funding Pool as may be required by the level of funding available. <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Separate Funding Pool of a Plan Sponsor that is not a Church Funds Agency does not have sufficient assets to pay Consolidated DB Plan benefits as they come due, such Plan Sponsor will be liable to make further Contributions to its Separate Funding Pool according to the Funding Policy. If such a Plan Sponsor does not make sufficient Contributions, the Administrator is authorized to reduce benefits payable under such Separate Funding Pool as may be required by the level of funding available. <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to or instead of making some or all of the Contributions specified in Sections 1.6(d)(ii) or (iii) above, a Plan Sponsor may have access to the General Agency Benefit Trust, to the extent provided therein, to fund its Plan Sponsor Liability under the Consolidated DB Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Reversion from a Funding Pool.</i> No Plan Sponsor may receive a reversion of assets in a Funding Pool except as provided in Section 12.3. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusive Benefit.</b> The Plan is for the exclusive benefit of Recipients and Accountholders.

If a sum in a 415 Suspense Account has not been so reallocated to Non-Matching Contribution Accounts or Matching Contribution Accounts within two Plan Years after the close of the Plan Year in which the sum was first allocated to the 415 Suspense Account, then such sum will be contributed to the Funding Pool of the Participant&rsquo;s Plan Sponsor. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Contribution Timing</i>.

Since defined contribution plan Contributions to Supplements One and Two have been frozen, the limitations of Code §415 are not expected to limit any benefits payable thereunder. Nevertheless, if required by Code §415(c) and/or applicable Regulations, contributions made under Supplements One and Two will be limited as so provided. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maximum Benefits.</b> Supplements One and Two pay Code §403(b)(9) grandfathered defined benefit plan benefits.

If the ACP Test is failed or expected to be failed for any Determination Year by a Plan Sponsor that is a Non-QCCO, such Plan Sponsor may pass the ACP Test by any one or more of the following means: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during the Determination Year: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reducing the amount of further; and/or <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; halting further <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACP Contributions made for each such Participant who is an HCE; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; within one year after the close of the Determination Year, refunding to each such Participant who is an HCE, as provided in Section 5.4(d) below, any excess ACP Contributions made for such Participant in accordance with Section 5.4(d) below; and/or <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; during, or within one year after the close of, the Determination Year (or such other deadline as may be provided in Regulations) making QNECs to one or more Participants who are Non-HCEs in accordance with Section 5.4(l) below to the extent necessary to pass the ACP Test. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Determination of Excess ACP Contributions.</i> If it is necessary, after taking into account any QNECs made under Section 5.4(c)(iii) above, to refund their excess Contributions pursuant to 5.4(c)(ii) above, then the ACP Contributions of the HCE or HCEs whose Actual Contribution Amount is the highest will first be reduced until their Actual Contribution Amount is equal to the greater of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Actual Contribution Amount that will cause the Highly Compensated ACP not to exceed the Maximum ACP; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Actual Contribution Amount of the HCE or HCEs who have the second highest Actual Contribution Amount. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same procedure will then be applied, if necessary, to the ACP Contributions of the HCEs who have the second highest Actual Contribution Amount (including those whose Actual Contribution Amount was reduced in the prior step), and so on until the Highly Compensated ACP no longer exceeds the Maximum ACP or as otherwise permitted or required under Regulations. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Refund of Excess ACP Contributions and Earnings and Losses</i>. After taking into account any QNECs made under Section 5.4(c)(iii) above, any excess ACP Contributions (as determined under Section 5.4(d) above) of each Participant who is an HCE will be distributed to such Participant. Each such distribution will include the share of net earnings or losses allocable to such distribution (including any arising during any Gap Period), determined in accordance with Section 5.4(f) or Section 5.4(g) below. All references to excess ACP Contributions in the Plan will be deemed to include such allocated earnings or losses. <br /> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Allocation of Earnings and Losses</i>. For the purpose of Section 5.4(e) above, the amount of earnings or losses allocated to the distribution of excess ACP Contributions will be equal to the net earnings or losses realized on the aggregate of the Participant&rsquo;s Matching Contribution Account under this Plan and after-tax contribution account, conditional contribution account, and matching contribution account under UMPIP for the Determination Year and any Gap Period thereafter, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of such distribution and the denominator of which is the sum of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant&rsquo;s Matching Contribution Account Balance as of the beginning of the Determination Year; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant&rsquo;s after-tax contribution account balance under UMPIP as of the beginning of the Determination Year; <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant&rsquo;s conditional contribution account balance under UMPIP as of the beginning of the Determination Year; <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant&rsquo;s matching contribution account balance under UMPIP as of the beginning of the Determination Year; and <br /> (v)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of ACP Contributions made during the Determination Year and any Gap Period thereafter. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Plan Sponsor or the Administrator may determine Gap Period earnings or losses as follows: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Determine the number of months in the Gap Period, including the month in which the distribution under Section 5.4(e) above is made if (and only if) such distribution is made after the 15</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;of such month; then <br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Multiply the number of months computed in Section 5.4(f)(1) above by 10% of the earnings or losses that accrued during the Determination Year.</span><span style="background-color: #ffff00"><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color: ">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Plan Sponsor or the Administrator otherwise elects under Section 5.4(g) below in accordance with Regulations, the computation and allocation of earnings and losses will be determined in accordance with this Section 5.4(f), as modified by Sections 5.4(f)(1) and (2) above. <br /> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Use of Other Method</i>. Notwithstanding Section 5.4(f) above, the Plan Sponsor or the Administrator may use any other reasonable method of allocating earnings or losses for any Determination Year, provided that such method: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; does not violate Code §403(b)(12) or Regulations thereunder, including making distributions under Section 5.4(e) above not later than seven days after the calculation of Gap Period earnings or losses (without including earnings or losses for such up-to-seven-day period); <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is applied consistently to all excess distributions and Participants for the year; and <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is the method used to allocate earnings or losses to Accounts generally. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Order of Distribution</i>. If a distribution of excess ACP Contributions must be made to a Participant who has received Matching Contributions under this Plan or made after-tax contributions and/or received conditional or matching contributions under UMPIP, then such distribution will be made from such Participant&rsquo;s Accounts or UMPIP accounts in the following order, until such point as all excess ACP Contributions have been distributed: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, any after-tax contributions under UMPIP that exceeded the amount that was eligible to earn conditional or matching contributions under UMPIP (for this purpose, conditional and matching contributions under UMPIP will be deemed to have been contributed first on account of before-tax contributions, next on account of Roth contributions, and finally on account of after-tax contributions); <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Second, a pro rata division between: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after-tax contributions under UMPIP; and <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the conditional or matching contributions that relate thereto under UMPIP or the Matching Contributions that relate thereto under this Plan; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, if Matching Contributions under this Plan or conditional or matching contributions under UMPIP remain after all after-tax contributions under UMPIP have been distributed, then conditional contributions under UMPIP, if any, followed by any matching contributions under UMPIP, if any, followed by any Matching Contributions under this Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forfeiture of Non-Vested Contributions</i>. If a distribution of excess non-Vested contributions must be made to a Participant under UMPIP, it will be handled as provided in UMPIP. <br /> (j)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Timing of Corrective Distributions</i>. All corrective distributions will be made, notwithstanding any other restrictions on distributions in the Plan, not later than 2½ months following the end of the Determination Year, if possible, and in any event not later than the last day of the Plan Year following the Determination Year. <br /> (k)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Aggregation of Plans</i>. If this Plan must be aggregated with one or more other plans maintained by the Plan Sponsor (such as UMPIP) or one or more Affiliates for one or more of such plans to satisfy the requirements of Code §§401(m), 401(a)(4), or 410(b), then the ACP Test will be run by determining the Non-Highly Compensated ACP and the Highly Compensated ACP as though all such plans were a single plan. Any adjustments to the Non-Highly Compensated ACP for the prior year will be made in accordance with IRS Notice 98-1 and any superseding guidance from the IRS. Plans may be aggregated to satisfy Code §401(m) only if they have the same plan year and use the same ACP testing method. <br /> (l)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>QNEC Limits</i>. A Plan Sponsor that is a Non-QCCO may allocate QNECs to one or more Participants who are Non-HCEs, but such QNECs will be disregarded in performing the ACP Test to the extent that they exceed the product of each such Non-HCE&rsquo;s Compensation and the greater of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5%; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2 times such Plan Sponsor&rsquo;s Representative Contribution Rate. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Other Limitations for Non-QCCOs.</b> Plan Sponsors that are Non-QCCOs will be limited each Plan Year with respect to: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Plan Sponsor Contributions permitted to the Plan for certain Participants (including HCEs); <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the amount of Compensation that may be taken into consideration under the Plan for certain Participants; and <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employees who may participate in the Plan, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the extent, if any, required by Code §403(b)(12) and the Regulations thereunder and the provisions of Code §§401(a)(4), 401(a)(5), 401(a)(17), 410(b), and any other applicable requirements of the Code or Regulations. Each such Plan Sponsor is responsible for complying with such limits and requirements. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitations Applicable to Defined Benefit Plans.</b> Benefits payable under the Consolidated DB Plan that are subject to Code §415(b) will comply with that Code provision and with applicable portions of Section B5 of RSP on the day before the Effective Date. <br /> <b>5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purpose of Limitations; Authority of Administrator.</b> The limitations of this Section 5 are intended to comply with the requirements of Code §§401(a)(4), 401(a)(5), 401(a)(17), 410(b), 415, 401(m), and any other applicable Code provisions and the Regulations issued thereunder, and will be construed accordingly. To the extent that such Regulations provide for any elections or alternative methods of compliance not specifically addressed in this Section 5, the Administrator or the Plan Sponsor will have the authority to make or revoke such election or use such alternative method of compliance unless such election or alternative method of compliance by its terms requires an amendment to the Plan. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b><CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 6 - Investments and Plan Accounting <br /> </CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Accounts.</b> The Administrator will establish and maintain one or more Accounts, corresponding to the appropriate Contributions, on behalf of each Accountholder who is allocated any of such Contributions under the Plan or who succeeds to any such amounts. Such Accounts (or sub-accounts) may include the following: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-Matching Contribution Account; <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matching Contribution Account; <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; QNEC Account; <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 415 Suspense Account; and <br /> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; any other Accounts the Administrator may choose to establish. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each Account represents the aggregate amount of Contributions attributable to that Account, adjusted for any applicable Debits and Credits, all in accordance with generally applicable accounting rules and procedures established by the Administrator from time to time. The maintenance of separate Account Balances will not require physical segregation of plan assets with respect to any Account. Accounts may overlap each other, such that given assets may be simultaneously classified under more than one applicable Account type. The Accounts maintained hereunder represent the Accountholders&rsquo; interests in the Plan and Trust and are intended as bookkeeping records to assist the Administrator in the administration of the Plan. The Administrator may create, aggregate, disaggregate, or discontinue any Account or Accounts, as best serves the Administrator&rsquo;s convenience, provided that each Accountholder&rsquo;s Account Balance is accounted for as long as such an Account Balance is due under the terms of the Plan. Any reference in the Plan to an Accountholder&rsquo;s &ldquo;Account(s)&rdquo; or &ldquo;Account Balance(s)&rdquo; refers to all amounts credited to the Accounts maintained in the Accountholder&rsquo;s name under the Plan unless the context otherwise requires. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment Fund Accounting.</b> To the extent the Trust is divided into separate investment funds, including funds established pursuant to Section 6.3, the undivided interest of each Accountholder&rsquo;s Account in each such fund will be determined in accordance with the accounting procedures, if any, specified in the trust agreement, investment management agreement, insurance contract, custodian agreement, or other document under which such fund is maintained. To the extent not inconsistent with such procedures, the Administrator may also use any other reasonable accounting procedures to track the investment of each Accountholder&rsquo;s assets under the Plan. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment of Accounts.</b><br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Self-Direction</i>. Subject to Section 6.3(b) below, Accountholders have the right to direct the investment of their Accounts among any one or combination of such investment funds as are offered for such purpose by the Administrator from time to time. The Administrator may subject this right to reasonable rules and limitations, including the obligation to direct account balances from multiple self-directed plans in the same way, as though they were one pooled account balance. If the Administrator offers LifeStage, Accountholders may also elect LifeStage to direct their Account Balances in accordance with rules established by the Administrator. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Default Investments</i>. The Administrator will establish a written procedure to govern an Accountholder&rsquo;s investments under the Plan, including specifying: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a default investment fund or funds; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that LifeStage will invest the Accountholder&rsquo;s Account Balance <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when the Accountholder elects not to direct the investment of his or her Account Balance or omits to direct it, as permitted under Section 6.3(a) above. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Investment Assistance</i>. The Administrator may (but need not) offer investment assistance to some or all Accountholders that may take the form of professional advice by individuals, a computerized program (including LifeStage), or some other means that either advises Accountholders or directs the investment of their Accounts. Such investment assistance may be offered on an opt in, opt out, or default basis, although Participants will retain the right of investment self-direction specified in Section 6.3(a) above. If the Administrator does offer such investment assistance, neither the Administrator, nor the Trustee, nor any Plan Sponsor will be liable for the results of any assistance provided by such entity offering investment assistance. Each Accountholder&rsquo;s sole remedy will be to exercise his or her right to direct the investment of his or her own Accounts as provided in Section 6.3(a) above. <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Direction by Administrator</i>. In cases where an Accountholder is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage his or her financial affairs (and the Administrator is given Notice of such fact), or in any other appropriate circumstance, the Administrator may, but need not, direct the investment of such Accountholder&rsquo;s Account, either as provided under Section 6.3(b) above or in any other manner appropriate for a fiduciary. The Administrator will not be liable to any person if it does not exercise its authority under this Section 6.3(d) or allows the default of Section 6.3(b) above to become effective. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 7 - Vesting AND FORFEITURE <br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Full Vesting.</b> An Accountholder&rsquo;s Account in the Plan will be fully Vested at all times to the extent funded, and will not be forfeited for any reason except as provided in Section 7.2. <br /> <b>7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forfeitures.</b> Notwithstanding Section 7.1, an Accountholder may forfeit an otherwise Vested Account in the following circumstances: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Missing Accountholder</i>. The Accounts of Accountholders who cannot be located will be handled as described in Section 8.6. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Uncashed Check</i>. Any Accountholder who has been issued a check for benefits due but who does not return or cash the check within a reasonable period established by the Administrator, after such reasonable Notice (or in the case of very small benefit amounts, no Notice) as the Administrator may determine, will forfeit such benefits. Such forfeited amounts will be contributed to the Funding Pool of the Accountholder&rsquo;s Plan Sponsor. Uncashed checks returned to the Administrator because the payee is missing or for other reasons are not covered by this Section 7.2(b). <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Relinquished Benefits</i>. If a Participant Relinquishes a benefit, it is forfeited. The Relinquished benefit will be contributed to the Funding Pool of the Participant&rsquo;s Plan Sponsor. <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Ineligible Person</i>. Benefits credited to an ineligible person will be handled as described in Section 3.6. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Contributions in Excess of Limits</i>. Contributions, as adjusted for Credits and Debits, may be forfeited in accordance with the terms of Section 5. <br /> <CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 8 - Payment of Benefits <br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Methods of Benefit Payment. </b>The following provisions are subject to Section 8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Normal Form of Payment</i>. The normal form of payment of an Accountholder&rsquo;s benefit is a cash lump-sum distribution equal to the Accountholder&rsquo;s total Account Balance in the Plan valued as of the Accounting Date coincident with or immediately before such distribution, and, except as otherwise provided herein, all benefits will be paid in such form. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Partial Distributions</i>. An Accountholder may elect one or more partial distributions of his or her Account Balance under the Plan, in accordance with rules established by the Administrator. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Payment in Cash Installments</i>. In accordance with rules established by the Administrator, an Accountholder may elect to receive his or her Account Balance in this Plan in cash installments. Such installments will be made in a series of distributions, payable annually or at more frequent intervals, determined in accordance with the provisions set forth below and rules issued by the Administrator. An Accountholder may specify either: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the dollar amount of each installment payment; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a period over which distributions will be made, in which case his or her Account Balance will be divided by the number of installments in such period to determine the dollar amount of the first installment. Thereafter, the remaining Account Balance will be divided by the remaining number of installments to determine the amount of the next installment, repeating this process for each succeeding installment. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In either case payments will continue until the Accountholder changes his or her distribution option (subject to rules promulgated by the Administrator) or until the Accountholder&rsquo;s entire Account Balance in the Plan has been distributed. Until such time, Credits and Debits will continue to be allocated to the Accountholder&rsquo;s Account in accordance with Section 6. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Election Procedures</i>. Wherever the Plan provides for an Accountholder to elect a form of distribution (including the right to defer receiving a distribution), the Administrator will provide a Notice enumerating and explaining the different forms of distribution. Such Notice will be provided not fewer than 30 nor more than 180 days before the scheduled commencement of such benefit, or within such other period as may be provided by any applicable provision of the Code. An Accountholder who has received such Notice may waive the 30-day period and elect to have his or her benefit distributed immediately. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Distributions.</b> The following provisions are subject to Section 8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Small Account Balances. </i>Except in the case of a Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant, if, at the time of a Participant&rsquo;s Retirement or Termination of Employment, or immediately after an Alternate Payee&rsquo;s benefit is segregated pursuant to a QDRO, such Accountholder&rsquo;s Aggregate Account Balance does not exceed $5,000, the entire amount of such Accountholder&rsquo;s Vested Account Balance in this Plan will be distributed as a lump sum to such Accountholder as soon as administratively feasible. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amount in excess of $1,000 distributed to such Accountholder from this Plan in accordance with this Section 8.2(a) will be rolled over in accordance with Section 8.5(b) unless such Accountholder: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; actively elects a distribution or a rollover under Section 8.5(a) to a specified plan or IRA; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has attained his or her Normal Retirement Date; <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is an Alternate Payee; or <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has attained his or her Required Beginning Date. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant must consent to such distribution, which will be made in accordance with Section 8.2(d). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution at</i> <i>Retirement</i>. A Participant with an Aggregate Account Balance that exceeds $5,000 who attains his or her Early, Normal, or Late Retirement Date may elect to begin receiving the distribution of some or all of his or her Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (subject to the limitations of Sections 8.1(d) and 8.2(g)) or he or she will be deemed to have elected to postpone receiving his or her distribution under Section 8.2(e). Such distribution will be made either in the normal form of payment provided in Section 8.1(a) or, if the Participant so elects, in any optional form of payment provided under Section 8.1. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution at</i> <i>Termination of Employment</i>. A Participant with an Aggregate Account Balance that exceeds $5,000: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who is a Clergy Employee and who incurs both a Termination of Employment and a Termination of Conference Relationship; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; who is a Lay Employee and who incurs a Termination of Employment, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may elect to begin receiving the distribution of some or all of his or her Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (subject to the limitations of Sections 8.1(d) and 8.2(g)) or he or she will be deemed to have elected to postpone receiving his or her distribution under Section 8.2(e). Such distribution will be made either in the normal form provided in Section 8.1(a) or, if the Participant so elects, in any optional form provided by Section 8.1. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution at</i> <i>Disability</i>. A Participant who is Disabled for reasons other than those qualifying him or her for STD Plan Disability may elect to begin receiving the distribution of some or all of his or her Account Balance as soon as administratively feasible thereafter (subject to the limitations of Sections 8.1(d) and 8.2(g)) or he or she will be deemed to have elected to postpone receiving his or her distribution under Section 8.2(e). Such distribution will be made either in the normal form provided in Section 8.1(a) or, if the Participant so elects, in any optional form provided by Section 8.1. <br /> (e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Delayed Distribution</i>. A Participant who has deferred the Distribution of some or all of his or her Accounts under the Plan under Sections 8.2(b)-(d) may elect to receive some or all of his or her remaining Accounts under the Plan at any later time (subject to the limitations of Sections 8.1(d) and 8.2(g)) in any form provided by Section 8.1. <br /> (f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Latest Commencement Date.</i> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the latest date upon which the distribution of a Participant&rsquo;s Account under the Plan may begin is the Required Beginning Date. Periodic distributions, including mandatory partial lump sum distributions, will be required thereafter as provided in Section 8.4. <br /> (g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Tax Notice</i>. Before making any Eligible Rollover Distribution, the Administrator will furnish each Accountholder with a Notice describing his or her right to a direct rollover of the distribution and the tax consequences of the distribution. Such Notice will be furnished not more than 180 days nor fewer than 30 days before the Recipient is entitled to receive such distribution, and no distribution will be made until 30 days after he or she has received such Notice unless he or she waives such 30 day period in writing in accordance with procedures established by the Administrator. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payments After an Accountholder&rsquo;s Death.</b> The following provisions are subject to Section 8.4 (relating to required minimum distributions). <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Distribution on Death.</i> Upon the death of an Accountholder, all amounts credited to such Accountholder&rsquo;s Account will be distributed to his or her Beneficiary in accordance with the normal form provided in Section 8.1(a) or, if the Beneficiary so elects, in any optional form provided by Section 8.1 and at any time that complies with Section 8.4 as to form and time of distribution.. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Proof of Death.</i> The Administrator may require such proper proof of death and such evidence of the right of any person to receive payment of the value of the Account of a deceased Accountholder as the Administrator may deem appropriate. The Administrator&rsquo;s determination of which person will receive payment is conclusive. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beneficiary.</i> A Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary will be determined in accordance with Section 8.12. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Required Minimum Distributions.</b> The provisions of Sections 8.1, 8.2, and 8.3 are intended to comply with the requirements of Code §401(a)(9), including specifically the minimum distribution incidental death benefit rule of Code §401(a)(9)(G), and the Regulations issued thereunder, and will be construed accordingly. Such Code and Regulation provisions are hereby incorporated herein by this reference, and will control over any form of distribution provided in this Plan that is inconsistent therewith. To the extent that such Regulations provide for any elections or alternative methods of compliance not specifically addressed in Sections 8.1, 8.2, or 8.3, the Administrator will have the authority to make or revoke such election or use such alternative method of compliance. The requirements of this Section 8.4 will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the Plan. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Time and Manner of Distribution</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Required Beginning Date</i>. The Participant's entire interest will be distributed, or will begin to be distributed, to the Participant no later than the Participant's Required Beginning Date. Unless a Participant or other Accountholder otherwise elects, a distribution at the Required Beginning Date or at the time of a later required distribution will not exceed the amount of the minimum required distribution. <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death of Participant Before Distributions Begin</i>. If the Participant dies before a distribution to the Participant begins, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed no later than as follows: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then distributions will begin to the surviving Spouse: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the surviving Spouse timely elects the Five-Year Distribution Option, then by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; or <br /> (II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the surviving Spouse does not timely elect the Five-Year Distribution Option, then by December 31 of the later of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died; or <br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the calendar year in which the Participant would have attained age 70½; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Participant's entire interest will be distributed no later than: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the surviving Spouse timely elects the Five-Year Distribution Option, December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; and <br /> (IV)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the surviving Spouse does not timely elect the Five-Year Distribution Option, then, in the Administrator&rsquo;s discretion, either: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over the Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse; or <br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; over a period certain not exceeding the Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse determined using the surviving Spouse's age as of the surviving Spouse's birthday in the calendar year: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; that contains the Annuity Starting Date where the Annuity Starting Date is before the first Distribution Calendar Year; or <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; immediately following the calendar year of the Participant's death where the Annuity Starting Date is not before the first Distribution Calendar Year. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timely election is one made before the earlier of the two applicable deadlines. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, then distributions will begin to the Designated Beneficiary: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Designated Beneficiary timely elects the Lifetime Distribution Option (not available to Beneficiaries that are estates or trusts), by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the Participant died; or <br /> (II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Designated Beneficiary does not timely elect the Lifetime Distribution Option, by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the Participant's entire interest will be distributed no later than: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Designated Beneficiary timely elects the Lifetime Distribution Option, then over the life of the Designated Beneficiary as provided in Section 8.4(c)(ii)(A); or <br /> (IV)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Designated Beneficiary does not timely elect the Lifetime Distribution Option, then by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A timely election is one made before the earlier of the two applicable deadlines. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, the Participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. <br /> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary and the surviving Spouse dies after the Participant but before distributions to the surviving Spouse begin, this Section 8.4(a)(ii), other than section 8.4(a)(ii)(A), will apply as though the surviving Spouse were the Participant. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this Section 8.4(a)(ii), unless Section 8.4(a)(ii)(D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the Participant's Required Beginning Date. If Section 8.4(a)(ii)(D) applies, distributions are considered to begin on the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Section 8.4(a)(ii)(A). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Forms of Distribution</i>. Unless a Participant's interest is distributed in the form of a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first Distribution Calendar Year, distributions will be made in accordance with Sections 8.4(b), (c), and (d). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Required Minimum Distributions During Participant's Lifetime</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Amount of Required Minimum Distribution for Each Distribution Calendar Year</i>. During a Participant's lifetime, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year is the lesser of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Valuation Account Balance by the distribution period in the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Regulation §1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's age as of the Participant's birthday in the Distribution Calendar Year; or <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; if the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary for the Distribution Calendar Year is the Participant's Spouse, the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Valuation Account Balance by the number in the Joint and Last Survivor Table set forth in Regulation §1.401(a)(9)-9, using the Participant's and Spouse's attained ages as of the Participant's and Spouse's birthdays in the Distribution Calendar Year. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Participant has a non-Spouse Designated Beneficiary, apply Section 8.4(b)(i)(A) above. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Lifetime Required Minimum Distributions Continue Through Year of Participant's Death</i>. Required minimum distributions will be determined under this Section 8.4(b) beginning with the first Distribution Calendar Year and up to and including the Distribution Calendar Year that includes the Participant's date of death <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Required Minimum Distributions After Participant's Death</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death on or After Date Distributions Begin</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary</i>. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Valuation Account Balance by the longer of the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant or the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as follows: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(I)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Participant's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of the Participant&rsquo;s death, reduced by one year for each year after the Participant&rsquo;s death. <br /> (II)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death using the surviving Spouse's age as of the Spouse's birthday in that year. For Distribution Calendar Years after the year of the surviving Spouse's death, the remaining Life Expectancy of the surviving Spouse is calculated using the age of the surviving Spouse as of the Spouse's birthday in the calendar year of the Spouse's death, reduced by one year for each later calendar year. <br /> (III)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Participant's surviving Spouse is not the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, the Designated Beneficiary's remaining Life Expectancy is calculated using the age of the Designated Beneficiary in the year following the year of the Participant's death, reduced by one year for each later year. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No Designated Beneficiary</i>. If the Participant dies on or after the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year after the year of the Participant's death, the minimum amount that will be distributed to the Default Beneficiary for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Valuation Account Balance by the Participant's remaining Life Expectancy calculated using the age of the Participant in the year of the Participant&rsquo;s death, reduced by one year for each later year. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death Before Date Distributions Begin</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Participant Survived by Designated Beneficiary</i>. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.4(d), if the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is a Designated Beneficiary, the minimum amount that will be distributed for each Distribution Calendar Year after the year of the Participant's death is the quotient obtained by dividing the Participant's Valuation Account Balance by the remaining Life Expectancy of the Participant's Designated Beneficiary, determined as provided in Section 8.4(c)(i). <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>No Designated Beneficiary</i>. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no Designated Beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the Participant's death, distribution of the Participant's entire interest to the Default Beneficiary will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the Participant's death. <br /> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to Surviving Spouse Are Required to Begin</i>. If the Participant dies before the date distributions begin, the Participant's surviving Spouse is the Participant's sole Designated Beneficiary, and such surviving Spouse dies before distributions are required to begin to the surviving Spouse under Section 8.4(a)(ii)(A), this Section 8.4(c)(ii) will apply as if the surviving Spouse were the Participant. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Small Account Balance</i>. Except in the case of a Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant, notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 8.4(a)-(c) to the contrary, if the total Account Balance payable to an Accountholder or Designated Beneficiary at the time of distribution does not exceed $5,000, the entire Account Balance will be distributed as a lump sum to such Accountholder or Designated Beneficiary as soon as administratively feasible in accordance with Section 8.2(a). A Disabled Participant or a Disabled Terminated Participant must consent to such distribution, which will be made in accordance with Section 8.2(d). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Direct Rollovers.</b><br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Elective Rollovers</i>. If a Participant or Terminated Participant receives an Eligible Rollover Distribution, the Participant or Terminated Participant has the right to direct the rollover of all or a portion of such distribution directly to an IRA, a defined contribution pension or profit-sharing trust qualified under Code §401(a), an annuity plan qualified under Code §403(a), a tax-sheltered annuity plan qualified under Code §403(b), or another &ldquo;eligible retirement plan&rdquo; as defined in Code §401(a)(31), that will accept such a rollover, provided that the amount so transferred must either be the entire amount of such distribution or must be at least $200. Any surviving Spouse or Alternate Payee who is a Spouse or former Spouse of a Participant or Terminated Participant who is entitled to receive an Eligible Rollover Distribution has the right to direct the rollover of all or a portion of such distribution directly to an eligible retirement plan that will accept such a rollover, provided that the amount so transferred must either be the entire amount of such distribution or must be at least $200. The Administrator will furnish each Accountholder to whom this Section 8.5(a) applies with a Notice describing his or her right to a direct rollover and the tax consequences of a distribution. Such Notice will be furnished not more than 180 days nor fewer than 30 days before the Accountholder is entitled to receive such distribution, and no distribution will be made until 30 days after he or she has received such Notice unless he or she waives such 30 day period in writing. The Administrator may adopt administrative procedures to implement direct rollovers, which may vary the time periods and minimum amounts set forth above, to the extent consistent with final Regulations issued under Code §401(a)(31). <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Auto-Rollovers</i>. When: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a distribution from this Plan to an Accountholder exceeds $1,000; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Accountholder&rsquo;s Aggregate Account Balance does not exceed $5,000; and <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Accountholder: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has not requested to receive the distribution; <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has not requested that the distribution be rolled over to another eligible retirement plan or IRA specified by the Accountholder; <br /> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has not attained his or her Normal Retirement Date; <br /> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a surviving Spouse; <br /> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is not an Alternate Payee; and <br /> (F)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; has not attained his or her Required Beginning Date, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then the Administrator will pay the distribution in a direct rollover to an IRA designated by the Administrator and invested in an investment type designated by the Administrator for the benefit of the Accountholder. Before making such rollover, the Administrator will provide, separately or as part of the Notice specified in Section 8.5(a) above, a Notice to such Accountholder stating that, absent his or her affirmative election, the distribution will be automatically rolled over to an IRA. The Notice will also identify the custodian, trustee, or other issuer of the IRA. In carrying out this Section 8.5(b), the Administrator will comply with IRS Notice 2005-5 and other applicable advice from the Internal Revenue Service or Regulations. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unclaimed Benefits.</b> The Administrator may prescribe uniform and nondiscriminatory rules for carrying out the following provisions:<u>db <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a portion (or all) of an Account remains to be distributed to an Accountholder at a time when it is due under the Plan (including, but not limited to, the Required Beginning Date) and the Administrator is then unable to locate the Accountholder, the Administrator will send Notice of such benefit due by a certified letter with return receipt requested to the last known address of the Accountholder. If the Accountholder fails to contact the Administrator within 12 months (except as provided in Section 8.6(b)), such benefit will be forfeited (except as provided in Section 8.6(c)) and will become the benefit of, in the case of a Participant or Alternate Payee, such person&rsquo;s Beneficiary, or, in the case of a Beneficiary, the Participant&rsquo;s or Alternate Payee&rsquo;s successor Beneficiary (including any Default Beneficiaries provided under the terms of the Plan), except in the case where a Beneficiary defers the distribution of an Account and is permitted to name his or her own Beneficiary, and in that case the Beneficiary&rsquo;s Beneficiary. The Administrator will then send Notice by certified letter as provided above to the Beneficiary or successor Beneficiary (including a Default Beneficiary), and the process specified above will be repeated until the last successor Beneficiary is sent a Notice. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the last successor or Default Beneficiary fails to contact the Administrator within 12 months after being sent a Notice of a benefit due as provided in Section 8.6(a), then the amount specified in Section 8.6(a) will be forfeited. The Administrator will contribute such forfeitures to the Funding Pool of the Accountholder&rsquo;s Plan Sponsor.<u>db <br /> </u>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, at any time before the expiration of the 12-month period described in Section 8.6(b), an Accountholder who is or was due a benefit described in Section 8.6(a) claims the benefit, the benefit will be paid to such Accountholder (notwithstanding any previous forfeiture) if it has not previously been paid to another Accountholder. If the 12-month period described in Section 8.6(b) has elapsed, then such benefit will be permanently forfeited and used by the Administrator as described in Section 8.6(b). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.7</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Payment with Respect to Incapacitated Accountholders.</b> Whenever, in the Administrator&rsquo;s opinion, a person entitled to receive any payment of a benefit under the Plan is under a legal disability (including being a minor) or is incapacitated in any way so as to be unable to manage such person&rsquo;s financial affairs, the Administrator may direct the Trustee to make payments directly to the person, to the person&rsquo;s legal representative (including a custodian for such person under the applicable Uniform Gifts or Transfers to Minors Act or similar legislation), or to a relative or friend of the person to be used exclusively for such person&rsquo;s benefit, or apply any such payment for the benefit of the person in such manner as the Administrator deems advisable. The decision of the Administrator, in each case, will be final, binding, and conclusive upon all persons interested hereunder. The Administrator will not be obligated to see to the proper application or expenditure of any payment so made. Any benefit payment (or installment thereof) made in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.7 will completely discharge the obligation for making such payment under the Plan, and the Administrator will have no further liability on account thereof. <br /> <b>8.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation on Liability for Distributions.</b> All rights and benefits, including benefit and investment elections, provided to a Participant in this Plan will be subject to the rights afforded to any Alternate Payee under a QDRO. Further, a distribution to an Alternate Payee will be permitted if such distribution is authorized by a QDRO, even if the affected Participant has not incurred a Termination of Employment or attained any particular age. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In-Service Withdrawals.</b> A Participant, whether or not he or she qualifies as a Terminated Participant, may withdraw all or any portion of his or her Account under this Plan if the Participant is Disabled for reasons other than those qualifying him or her only for STD Plan Disability. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Disclaimer.</b> Any Accountholder may Disclaim any benefit or portion thereof that is due to him or her if done in writing in a Form acceptable to the Administrator and if done before receiving it. The effect of a Disclaimer is to treat such Accountholder as if he or she had died before the benefit or portion was due to him or her. <br /> <b>8.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trailing Account Balances.</b> If an Accountholder who has received a distribution of his or her entire Account Balance later receives a credit to such Account, because of a delayed Contribution, a delayed crediting of earnings, or a correction in accounting or for some other reason, the Administrator will distribute the balance in the Account to the Accountholder as soon as practicable thereafter. If the Account Balance is under $200, the Account Balance will be distributed as a lump sum to the Accountholder as soon as administratively feasible. If the Account Balance is $200 or more, it will be distributed in the same form of payment that applied to the Accountholder&rsquo;s previous distribution. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneficiary. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Person or Persons</i>. A Beneficiary may be one or more legal persons, namely, individual(s), trust(s), estate(s), or other legal person(s). There may be a hierarchy of potential Beneficiaries, but the actual Beneficiary is the person or persons entitled to receive a distribution under the Plan, determined at the time or times any such distribution is payable, or at the time the Accountholder died or disappeared, as may be specified in the Plan. If one or more persons are all entitled to share in a given distribution, then the class of such persons is the Beneficiary. The persons in such a class may share equally or unequally in the distribution, as may be provided in the Plan or in a Beneficiary designation. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beneficiary Hierarchy</i>. When there is more than one potential Beneficiary, the actual Beneficiary will be determined in the following order: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the primary Designated Beneficiary (subject to Section 8.12(d)); <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the secondary Designated Beneficiary (subject to Section 8.12(d)); and <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Default Beneficiary, in accordance with Section 8.12(f) or (g); <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;taken in succession, one following another, until a qualifying Beneficiary who is alive (in the case of an individual) and can be identified, located, and verified by the Administrator is established. When a Beneficiary consists of a class of persons, all of such persons who can be located will receive an equal share of any distribution to such class, unless the designation clearly specifies another division (which division may not be <i>per stirpes</i>). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beneficiary Designation</i>. A Participant may designate a Beneficiary in such Form as is satisfactory to the Administrator, which designation must be postmarked, sent by private courier, or received by the Administrator during the Participant&rsquo;s lifetime to be valid. If more than one person is specified as the Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary, each such person will take an equal share, per capita, unless the Participant clearly specifies another division (which division may not be <i>per stirpes</i>). When a Participant executes a Beneficiary designation that is accepted as valid by the Administrator, it supersedes all earlier Beneficiary designations. A Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary designation applies to all Accounts in the Plan. If a Participant has not designated a Beneficiary under the Plan but did designate a Beneficiary under RSP, such Beneficiary designation will apply under this Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Surviving Spouse.</i> Notwithstanding a Participant&rsquo;s Beneficiary designation to the contrary, if the Spouse of a deceased or missing Participant survives him or her, such surviving Spouse will be his or her Beneficiary, and the Participant&rsquo;s Account will be paid to such Spouse unless: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such Spouse consents in writing after the Participant&rsquo;s death, or had consented in writing before the Participant&rsquo;s death, to the Participant&rsquo;s designation of another Designated Beneficiary, witnessed in either case by a Plan Sponsor or an Administrator representative (other than the Participant) or a notary public; provided, however, that the Administrator need not solicit such a Spousal consent. Such Spouse must consent as specified above to each change in Designated Beneficiary unless the original consent expressly permits the Participant to further change his or her Designated Beneficiary without the requirement of further consent by such Spouse; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant was legally separated from such Spouse or had been abandoned (within the meaning of local law) by such Spouse, and, in either case, the Participant had a court order to such effect; <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; such Spouse Disclaims the Participant&rsquo;s Account, in writing in a Form acceptable to the Administrator, before receiving it. The Disclaimer must be of the entire benefit. The effect of such Disclaimer is to treat such Spouse as if he or she had predeceased the Participant; or <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; neither the Participant nor the Administrator can locate such Spouse (provided, however, that the Administrator will have no obligation to search for such Spouse). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Participant&rsquo;s designation of Beneficiary Form received and accepted by the Administrator under any predecessor to the Plan before January 1, 1993 will continue to be effective on and after January 1, 1993, notwithstanding such Participant&rsquo;s marriage after January 1, 1993, whether or not such Participant&rsquo;s Spouse consented to the Beneficiary designated on such Form. Any designation of Beneficiary Form accepted by the Administrator on or after January 1, 1993 will revoke any such pre-January 1, 1993 designation of Beneficiary Form. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Effect of Divorce.</i> Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the other Sections of this Section 8.12, an Accountholder&rsquo;s divorce on or after the Effective Date will automatically revoke any Beneficiary designation in favor of the Accountholder&rsquo;s Spouse made before the divorce, unless the Accountholder completes another Beneficiary designation in favor of the former Spouse after the divorce. Until such time as a new designation of Beneficiary is filed with the Administrator, benefits will be payable as though the former Spouse had predeceased the Accountholder. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Default Beneficiary</i>. An Accountholder&rsquo;s Default Beneficiary is: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Accountholder&rsquo;s Spouse, if any, provided that the Administrator can identify, locate, and verify such Spouse; or otherwise <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Accountholder&rsquo;s estate. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Beneficiary of an Accountholder</i>. An individual other than a Participant who becomes an Accountholder and does not receive an immediate distribution of that Account may name a Beneficiary in accordance with such procedures and in such Form as the Administrator may accept or require. Subject to the provisions of Section 8.6, such Beneficiary will receive the Accountholder&rsquo;s Account if the Accountholder dies or is missing when a distribution is due.

The Administrator has discretionary authority to grant or deny benefits under this Plan. Benefits under this Plan will be paid only if the Administrator decides in its discretion that the applicant is entitled to them. Rules and procedures adopted by the Administrator may vary any provision of the Plan that is administrative or ministerial in nature (including the time provided for performing any act, if not required by law), without the necessity of a formal amendment. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

The Administrator may also rely on any power of attorney, guardianship document, or similar document that it believes to be genuine and operative. The Administrator may request instructions in writing from a Plan Sponsor, Recipient, Accountholder, or others, as applicable, on other matters, and may rely and act thereon.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Recipient or an Accountholder is not required to apply for or begin the receipt of benefits under the Plan until his or her Required Beginning Date. Written Notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent to the Plan Sponsor and to the Claimant within 45 days after all required forms and materials related to the claim have been filed. If special circumstances require an extension of time, written Notice of the extension will be furnished to the Claimant, and written Notice of the disposition of a claim will be sent within an additional 90 days. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Denial of Claim. </i>If any claim for benefits under the Plan is wholly or partially denied, the Administrator will send the Claimant written Notice of the denial, within the period specified in Section 10.11(a) above, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, setting forth the following information: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the specific reasons for such denial; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; specific reference to pertinent Plan provisions on which the denial is based; <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a description of any additional material or information necessary for the Claimant to perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information is necessary; and <br /> (iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; an explanation of the Plan&rsquo;s appeals procedures. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal of Denial</i>. If a Claimant is denied benefits under Section 10.11(b), the Claimant has the right to appeal the decision within 90 days after the date of the claim denial, in accordance with the following procedures: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Intermediary Appeal Procedure</i>. The Administrator will establish an intermediary appeals procedure containing no more than a three-level process. <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Final Appeal Procedure</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the Claimant wishes to appeal the denial of benefits under Section 10.11(c)(i), the Claimant must file with the Final Appeals Committee a written appeal and supporting documents, using any Form required by the Administrator for the purpose, within 90 days after the date of the denial issued under Section 10.11(c)(i). Such an appeal may be addressed to the Administrator or in care of the person or persons specified in the Notice of denial issued under Section 10.11(c)(i). <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A timely filed appeal will be heard by the Final Appeals Committee at its next meeting, unless additional time is needed for processing, in which case the Claimant will be so notified and the appeal will be heard at the following meeting of the Final Appeals Committee. Appeals or documents filed fewer than 30 days before the next meeting of the Final Appeals Committee will not be considered by the Final Appeals Committee except by its leave and discretion. <br /> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant or a representative of the Plan Sponsor may request permission to appear personally or by teleconference before the Final Appeals Committee to present evidence with respect to the claim, subject to conditions and time limitations set by the Final Appeals Committee, but the expense for any such personal appearance must be borne by the Claimant or the Plan Sponsor. <br /> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee will decide a Claimant&rsquo;s appeal, and its decision will be final. The decision will be implemented by the Administrator. <br /> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Claimant will be given written Notice of the decision on appeal. If the decision is a denial, such Notice will include specific reasons for the decision, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the Claimant, and specific references to the pertinent Plan provisions on which the decision is based. Such written Notice will be mailed to the Claimant by the Administrator within 15 days following the decision by the Final Appeals Committee. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeals Committees</i>. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Appeals Intermediary is a committee appointed by the Administrator. <br /> (B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Final Appeals Committee of the Administrator is a committee of the Board of Directors of the General Board that is selected from time to time by that Board of Directors. <br /> (C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Appeals Intermediary and the Final Appeals Committee may develop rules and procedures to govern its own meetings and actions and the filing and decision of claim appeals by Claimants. <br /> (D)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by either appeals committee to decide a claim appeal by the deadline for such a decision will be deemed a denial of the claim. The Claimant may then proceed to the next step of the procedure. <br /> (E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any failure by the Claimant to appeal any claim denial by the deadline for doing so will be deemed to be a final resolution of the claim, and the Claimant will be deemed to have waived his or her right to file an appeal or a further appeal or to pursue any other remedy, including filing a lawsuit. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Appeal a Condition Precedent to Civil Action</i>. No cause of action in civil law with respect to any alleged violation of the terms and conditions of this Plan may be commenced or maintained by any Claimant, Recipient, or Accountholder unless and until such Claimant, Recipient, or Accountholder has initiated and completed the claim and appeal process as set forth in Sections 10.11(a) and (c). Any such cause of action must be filed with a court of competent jurisdiction within six months after the date on the written Notice of denial described in Section 10.11(c)(ii)(E) or such cause of action will be deemed waived, provided, however, that such six-month limit will apply only if it is described in such Notice of denial. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Qualified Domestic Relations Orders.</b> The provisions of Section 12.2 notwithstanding, all or part of a Participant&rsquo;s Vested benefits arising under this Plan may be transferred to one or more Alternate Payees on the basis of a &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order,&rdquo; as that term is defined in Code §414(p), provided that: (1) such order was issued by a court having jurisdiction over the Administrator; or (2) such order was entered by any other court and the Administrator, in its sole discretion, determines that the order is a QDRO. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When appropriate, the Administrator will provide a Participant involved in marital litigation with information regarding the nature and value of the Participant&rsquo;s benefits and will assist the Participant and the court in interpreting that information. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator will establish a written procedure to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such QDROs. Such procedure will provide that during the period in which a determination is being made with respect to the qualified status of an order received by the Administrator and for 30 days thereafter: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Administrator will direct the Trustee to segregate and separately account for any sums payable to the Participant that the order requires to be paid to the Alternate Payee; and <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Participant will be prohibited from electing to receive any distribution that would compromise the rights granted to the Alternate Payee by the order, without the Alternate Payee&rsquo;s written consent. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Neither the Alternate Payee nor any person claiming through the Alternate Payee will have the right to transfer benefits to another Alternate Payee. The benefits transferred pursuant to a QDRO will be administered in accordance with the provisions of this Plan. With respect to benefits transferred to an Alternate Payee pursuant to this Section 10.12, the Alternate Payee will have all of the rights and duties of a fully Vested Participant who has incurred a Termination of Employment, to the exclusion of any claim thereto on the part of the Participant. <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A subpoena or other instrument of judicial process that: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is directed to the Administrator, its constituent corporations, or its officers or employees; <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appears on its face to be issued in the course of marital litigation to which a Participant is a party; and <br /> (iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; seeks information regarding the nature or value of the Participant&rsquo;s pension benefits; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may be honored by the Administrator, in its sole discretion, without interposing any defense on the grounds of technical or jurisdictional defect. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Administrator may charge to the Plan its costs of handling QDROs, including, but not limited to, attorneys&rsquo; fees, litigation expenses, and a reasonable charge for its services in connection therewith. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 11 &ndash; Amendment AND Termination of Plan <br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amendment.</b><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>General Conference</i>.

The Plan Sponsors have no right, title, or interest in the assets of the Plan or the Trust and no portion of the Trust or the assets of the Plan or interest therein may at any time revert to or be repaid to the Plan Sponsors, except as otherwise provided below: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to Section 12.3(d) below, upon termination of the Plan, any assets remaining, after the satisfaction of all fixed and contingent liabilities by the payment of all such liabilities due, the transfer, merger, or spinoff of such liabilities and appropriate assets to another plan, and/or the annuitization of any remaining liabilities with an insurance or annuity provider selected by the Administrator, may revert to the applicable Plan Sponsor(s). <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a contribution is made to the Plan by a Plan Sponsor by a mistake of fact, then such contribution will be returned to the Plan Sponsor (adjusted for any Debits or Credits) if: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Plan Sponsor sends a written request for its return to the Administrator within one year after the contribution was made, and <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the Plan Sponsor documents such mistake to the satisfaction of the Administrator within a reasonable time thereafter. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a contribution is sent to the Plan by a Plan Sponsor that the Administrator determines within 30 days is an error or a mistake, the Administrator will not accept the payment as a Contribution to the Plan and will return the payment (or an amount equal to it) to the Plan Sponsor. <br /> (d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Except as provided in Sections 12.3(b) and (c) above, no Plan Sponsor may receive a reversion of assets in a Funding Pool unless assets remain after all Plan Sponsor Liabilities under the Consolidated DB Plan have been satisfied as to all Participants, Beneficiaries, and any other persons entitled to benefits under that Funding Pool by the payment of all benefits due, by annuitizing any remaining benefits with an insurance or annuity provider selected by the Administrator, and/or by converting, merging, or spinning off any remaining benefits into Actuarially Equivalent lump sum or annuity benefits to be paid from another plan, fund, or insurance contract. Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsors may receive a reversion of assets only from the Common Funding Pool. A Plan Sponsor that is not a Church Funds Agency may receive a reversion of assets only from its Separate Funding Pool. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the General Agency Benefit Trust exists when any reversion under this Section 12.3(d) is payable (other than a reversion under Sections 12.3(b) or (c) above), it will be paid to the General Agency Benefit Trust and accounted for under the terms of such trust. If the General Agency Benefit Trust does not then exist, reversions from the Common Funding Pool will be divided among the then-existing Plan Sponsors participating therein according to reasonable actuarial principles as determined by the Administrator after consultation with such Plan Sponsors. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Construction.</b> The Plan and each of its provisions will be construed under, and their validity determined by, the laws of the State of Illinois, other than its laws respecting choice of law, to the extent such laws are not preempted or superseded by any federal law. <br /> <b>12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limitation of Liability.</b> All benefits hereunder are contingent upon, and payable solely from the assets of the Trust (including any annuities purchased with Trust assets), which derive from such Contributions as may be received by the Trustee and the investment results of the Trustee. No financial obligations, other than those that can be met by the Contributions actually received, adjusted by any Debits or Credits, including the Administrator&rsquo;s or Trustee&rsquo;s expenses or charges against the Trust&rsquo;s assets, will be assumed by the Administrator or the Trustee. To the extent that assets of the Plan attributable to a Recipient or an Accountholder have been transferred to a separate dedicated trust, all benefits to which the Recipient or Accountholder is entitled under that Plan will be provided only out of such trust and only to the extent the trust is adequate therefor. Further, if the Trustee segregates Trust assets by sub-plan within the Plan, all benefits to which a Recipient or an Accountholder is entitled under that sub-plan will be provided only out of such segregated portion of the Trust and only to the extent such segregated portion is adequate therefor. Neither the Administrator, the Trustee, nor the Plan Sponsors nor their officers, employees, contractors, or agents will be personally responsible or otherwise liable for the payment of any benefits hereunder. <br /> <b>12.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alternative Dispute Resolution.</b> If a dispute arises out of or is related to the relationship between any Plan Sponsor and the Administrator or Trustee, the parties agree first to try in good faith to settle the dispute by mediation through the American Arbitration Association, or another mediation/arbitration service mutually agreed upon by the parties, before resorting to arbitration. Thereafter, any remaining unresolved controversy or claim arising out of or relating to the relationship between the Plan Sponsor and the Administrator or Trustee will be settled by binding arbitration through the American Arbitration Association, or the other mediation/arbitration service mutually agreed upon by the parties. <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The site of the mediation and/or arbitration will be in a city mutually agreed to by the parties. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The laws of the State of Illinois will apply in situations where federal law is not applicable. The applicable rules of the selected arbitration service will apply. If the service allows the parties to choose the number of arbitrators, unless another number is mutually agreed to, any arbitration hereunder will be before three arbitrators. The award of the arbitrators, or a majority of them, will be final. Judgment upon the award rendered may be entered in any court, state or federal, having jurisdiction. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fees and costs for mediation will be borne equally by the parties. The fees and costs of arbitration will be allocated to the parties by the arbitrators. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Titles and Headings.</b> The titles and headings of the Sections of this instrument are placed herein for the convenience of reference only, and in the case of any conflicts, the text of this Plan, rather than the titles or headings, will control. <br /> <b>12.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Number and Gender.</b> Wherever used herein, the singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular, except where the context requires otherwise. Similarly, the male includes the female and vice versa. <br /> <b>12.9</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>USERRA.</b> Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the contrary, contributions, benefits, and Service credit with respect to qualified military service will be provided in accordance with Code §414(u). <br /> <b>12.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Participant, Beneficiary, and Accountholder Duties.</b> Each Participant, Beneficiary, Recipient, and Accountholder entitled to benefits under the Plan must file with the Administrator and Plan Sponsor from time to time such person&rsquo;s mailing address and each change of mailing address. Failure to do so may result in the forfeiture of benefits otherwise due under the Plan. Each such person must also apply for benefits at the appropriate time and in the appropriate Form in accordance with the terms of the Plan and the procedures of the Administrator to be assured of receiving such benefits. <br /> <b>12.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adequacy of Evidence.</b> Evidence that is required of anyone under the Plan must be executed or presented by proper individuals or parties and may be in the form of certificates, affidavits, documents, or other information that the person acting on such evidence considers pertinent and reliable. <br /> <b>12.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Notice to Other Parties.</b> A Notice mailed first class, postage prepaid, to a Recipient or an Accountholder at his or her last address filed with the Administrator will be binding on the Recipient or Accountholder for all purposes of the Plan and will be deemed given on the date on the Notice. A claim for benefits, beneficiary designation, or other Notice mailed first class, postage prepaid, from a Recipient or an Accountholder to the Administrator will be deemed given on the date of the postmark. A Notice may be addressed to the Administrator at the following address (or such other address as the Administrator may designate from time to time): <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Administrator of the Retirement Plan for General Agencies<br /> General Board of Pension and Health Benefits of The United Methodist Church<br /> 1201 Davis Street<br /> Evanston, IL&nbsp;&nbsp;60201-4188 <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiver of Notice.</b> Any Notice under the Plan may be waived by the person entitled to Notice. Waiver of Notice in one instance, however, will not be deemed to be a waiver in a later instance. <br /> <b>12.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Successors.</b> This Plan is binding on the Plan Sponsors, and on all persons entitled to benefits hereunder, and their respective successors, heirs, and legal representatives. <br /> <b>12.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Severability.</b> If any provision of the Plan is held illegal or invalid for any reason, such illegal or invalid provision will not affect the remaining provisions of the Plan, and the Plan will be construed and enforced as though such illegal or invalid provisions had never been contained in the Plan. <br /> <b>12.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Supplements.</b> The Plan may be amended from time to time as provided in Section 11.1 by adding one or more Supplements to the Plan to address special situations not applicable to all Plan Sponsors or to all Employees, Participants, Beneficiaries, Recipients, or Accountholders. Any such Supplement will specify the Plan Sponsors and persons covered and any special rules or benefits related to them. To the extent that any such rules or benefits are in conflict with the general provisions of the Plan, such rules or benefits will supersede the general provisions of the Plan as to the persons covered by the Supplement to the extent they are in conflict with such general provisions. Except as otherwise provided in a Supplement, all of the provisions of the Plan will apply to the persons covered by the Supplement. <br /> <b>12.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Change in Classification.</b> A Clergy Employee may cease to be a Clergyperson or may continue as a Clergyperson but may cease to be Appointed to a ministry with a Plan Sponsor. If such a person remains employed by a Plan Sponsor, such person will be reclassified as a Lay Employee. Similarly, a Lay Employee may qualify as a Clergyperson or may already be a Clergyperson and may be Appointed to work for a Plan Sponsor. In such case, the Lay Employee will be reclassified as a Clergy Employee. The intent of the Active Plan is to continue to cover Employees who change classification from Clergy Employee to Lay Employee or vice versa without interruption. Benefits will continue to accrue and Contributions will continue to be made. The right to receive benefits from the Active Plan will be governed by the Participant&rsquo;s status when such Participant is eligible for such benefits. Specific provisions throughout the Active Plan govern any specific situations addressed therein. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement One <br /> </b></b></u></u></CENTER><CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the <br /> <center> Retirement Plan for General Agencies <br /> </center></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b><br /> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER>THE UNIFORM STAFF PENSION FUND <br /> </CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S1.1 &ndash; THE PLAN <br /> </b><br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History.</b> General Conference authorized the establishment of USPF effective January 1, 1974. USPF was a defined benefit plan that was partially frozen and merged into SPP, effective January 1, 1985, at the direction of General Conference. SPP was a defined contribution plan that preserved USPF as supplement one to SPP. Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP, and participants with a USPF benefit not yet In Pay Status were given the option of retaining benefits measured by one of two defined benefit formulas or converting their defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Those participants who retained the USPF defined benefit accrued benefit (including those already In Pay Status under USPF) were covered in supplement one to SRBP. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to spin-off participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan), leaving only Plan Sponsor contributions in SRBP. General Conference also authorized surplus assets in supplement one to be transferred to the General Agency Benefit Trust of The United Methodist Church to be used for other General Agency benefit purposes. Effective January 1, 2007, SRBP was amended and restated as RSP, and supplement one to SRBP was amended and restated as supplement one to RSP. When RSP was amended and restated as the Plan, effective on the Effective Date, supplement one to RSP was amended and restated as Supplement One to the Plan. <br /> <b>S1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF.</b> USPF is now a partially frozen plan consisting of Supplement One, applicable provisions of Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the Active Plan, Supplement Two (to the extent necessary to participate in the Consolidated DB Plan), and any Adoption Agreement executed by a USPF Plan Sponsor (although USPF Plan Sponsors are not required to execute an Adoption Agreement to be USPF Plan Sponsors). USPF provides only defined benefit plan benefits to USPF Participants, their Contingent Annuitants, and their Beneficiaries. No further accrual of benefits (other than that afforded by increasing USPF Compensation) will be credited under USPF after December 31, 2006, but further Service may accrue for the purpose of vesting in the frozen USPF benefits previously accrued. USPF is part of the Consolidated DB Plan. <br /> </b></b><CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S1.2 &ndash; USPF ELIGIBILITY <br /> </b><br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pension Benefits Eligibility.</b> Pension benefits under USPF are frozen. Participants in USPF on the day before the Effective Date who were eligible for the USPF Formula Benefit or the USPF Revised Formula Benefit on that date will continue to be eligible for such benefits on and after the Effective Date in accordance with Section S1.3 (as will their Contingent Annuitants and Beneficiaries). No other persons are eligible for such benefits and no new Participants can become eligible for those frozen benefits. <br /> <b>S1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vesting.</b> A Participant in this Supplement One is or will become Vested (subject to Section 7.2) in a USPF Formula Benefit or a USPF Revised Formula Benefit described in this Supplement One for which he or she is eligible as provided below: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; upon the earlier of: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his or her Early Retirement Date; or <br /> (ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the date he or she completes three years of Service; or <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a Participant who participated in USPF before January 1, 1985, upon Termination of Employment if he or she allowed the accumulations in his or her personal Account to remain in SPP or SRBP. (The personal Account under SPP held a Participant&rsquo;s before-tax and after-tax employee contributions to USPF.) <br /> <CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S1.3 &ndash; USPF PENSION BENEFITS <br /> </b><br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S1.3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pre-93 Benefits.</b> USPF Pension Benefits payable to USPF Participants who were In Pay Status before January 1, 1993 will continue to be paid in the same form and amount, and to the same Recipients, as were previously provided for under USPF or SPP. <br /> <b>S1.3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1993-94 Election.</b> During 1993 and 1994 USPF Participants who were not In Pay Status before January 1, 1993 were given an election to receive their benefits under USPF in one of three alternative benefit forms: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the USPF Formula Benefit (the default election); <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the USPF Revised Formula Benefit; or <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the conversion of their defined benefit plan USPF benefit into an equivalent defined contribution plan benefit. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USPF Participants who elected option (a) or (b) (or are deemed to have elected option (a)) are receiving or will receive their USPF Pension Benefits as described in Section S1.3.3. USPF Participants who elected option (c) have had their benefits under USPF converted to a defined contribution plan Account Balance, which has since been transferred to SRBP, to RSP, and to the Active Plan as provided in Supplement Two. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S1.3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Payment of Benefits.</b> A USPF Participant&rsquo;s Vested USPF Formula Benefit or Vested USPF Revised Formula Benefit (whichever was elected as provided in Section S1.3.2) will be paid in the USPF Normal Form of Benefit at the USPF Participant&rsquo;s Early, Normal, or Late Retirement Date, subject to the limits of Section 5 and payable in accordance with rules and procedures determined by the Administrator to be in accordance with or analogous to the provisions of supplement one of RSP on the day before the Effective Date. <br /> <b>S1.3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Survivor Benefits.</b> If a Vested USPF Participant dies before Retiring, a survivor benefit will be paid, beginning as of the first of the month coincident with or next following his or her death: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a USPF Participant with a Spouse on his or her date of death, to his or her Spouse in the amount of 70% of the USPF Participant&rsquo;s USPF Formula Benefit or USPF Revised Formula Benefit (whichever was elected as provided in Section S1.3.2); or <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; in the case of a USPF Participant with no Spouse on his or her date of death, to his or her Beneficiary (designated or specified in accordance with Section 8.12) in the form of a 10-Year Certain Annuity that is based on the USPF Participant&rsquo;s USPF Formula Benefit or USPF Revised Formula Benefit (whichever was elected as provided in Section S1.3.2). <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In either case, the monthly benefits payable will be periodically adjusted in accordance with the USPF Adjustment or the USPF Revised Adjustment, whichever is applicable based on the election in Section S1.3.2. <br /> <CENTER><b>SECTION S1.4 &ndash; USPF FUNDING <br /> </b><br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S1.4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF Assets.</b> The assets available to fund supplement one to RSP on the day before the Effective Date will continue to be available to fund the benefits payable under Supplement One after the Effective Date. The assets will be held in the Trust by the Trustee as part of the Consolidated DB Plan. The Trustee also has a claim on assets in the General Agency Benefit Trust (as provided therein) to fund benefits payable under Supplement One. <br /> <b>S1.4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USPF Accounting.</b> The Administrator may separately account for (and create Accounts for) and use certain assets in the Common Funding Pool or any Separate Funding Pool that are primarily held for the payment of the benefits under Supplement One. As described in Section 1.6(d), however, such assets are available if needed to pay other benefits due under the Consolidated DB Plan, and assets contributed to pay other benefits under the Consolidated Benefit Plan are available to pay benefits due under Supplement One. <br /> <b>S1.4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Contributions.</b> If the assets in the Common Funding Pool or any Separate Funding Pool under the Consolidated DB Plan are not sufficient under the Funding Policy, in the Administrator&rsquo;s judgment, to adequately provide for benefits due under the Consolidated DB Plan and its subplans (including Supplement One), each Plan Sponsor will make Contributions in an amount that is specified by the Administrator for such Plan Sponsor as being due by the Due Date. <br /> <b>S1.4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Investment of Assets.</b> Pending distribution or other use of the assets in the Common Funding Pool or any Separate Funding Pool, the Trustee will invest the assets as described in the Trust. <br /> </b></b><CENTER><b><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supplement Two <br /> to the <br /> <center> Retirement Plan for General Agencies <br /> </center></b></b></u></u></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u></b><br /> <CENTER><br /> <u><b><br /> RETIREMENT SECURITY PROGRAM FOR GENERAL AGENCIES <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </u>SECTION S2.1 &ndash; THE PLAN <br /> </b><br /> </CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S2.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; History.</b> General Conference authorized the establishment of the original predecessor of the Plan, USPF, effective January 1, 1974. USPF was a defined benefit plan that was partially frozen and merged into SPP, a defined contribution plan, effective January 1, 1985, at the direction of General Conference. Effective January 1, 1993, General Conference directed that SPP be amended and restated as SRBP, and participants with a USPF benefit were given the option of retaining benefits measured by one of two defined benefit formulas or converting their defined benefit accrued benefits into an equivalent lump sum that would be added to their SRBP account balance. Those participants who retained the USPF defined benefit accrued benefit were covered in supplement one to SRBP and later supplement one to RSP. Effective January 1, 1998, General Conference authorized the amendment of SRBP to move participant contributions to another plan (the Personal Investment Plan, later succeeded by UMPIP), leaving only General Agency contributions in SRBP and successor plans. Effective January 1, 2007, as approved by General Conference 2004, SRBP was amended and restated as RSP. SRBP was frozen as of December 31, 2006, and participant accounts were transferred to RSP participant accounts in the RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan. In addition to this RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan benefit, RSP also included the RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan. These two RSP benefits are addressed in this Supplement Two. <br /> <b>S2.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Frozen Plan.</b> In connection with the amendment and restatement of RSP as the Plan as of the Effective Date, RSP was frozen as of the day before the Effective Date. All benefits accrued under RSP (both RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan Accrued Benefits and RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan Account Balances) as of the day before the Effective Date that have not already been forfeited or paid as of that date under the terms of RSP will thereafter be fully Vested. No further Accrued Benefits or contributions will be earned under this Supplement Two after the day before the Effective Date for any past, present, or future RSP Participant, except for contributions due under RSP relating to periods on or before the day before the Effective Date. After the day before the Effective Date: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interest, gains, and losses may still accrue on the investments in an RSP Participant&rsquo;s Account under this Supplement Two; and <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; benefits currently being paid or due to be paid under RSP may continue to be paid in the same form and amount, and to the same Accountholders or Recipients, as was previously the case, <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but only until the transfer described in Section S2.2.1 is completed for each such Participant. New benefits will not be paid under this Supplement Two. Instead, they will be transferred as provided in Section S2.2.1 and paid under the Active Plan. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S2.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan.</b> As of the Effective Date, the frozen RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan benefits described in Section S2.1.2 will be divided into two groups: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Pay Status Benefits</i>. Those benefits In Pay Status will continue to be paid on and after the Effective Date in the same form and amount, and to the same Recipients, as was previously the case. Such benefits will continue to be paid under this Supplement Two and the Consolidated DB Plan, with any questions as to form, amount, or proper Recipient(s) being resolved with reference to the RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan as it existed on the day before the Effective Date. Such payments will continue until all such benefits are paid or are otherwise settled in accordance with Section 12.3. For the purpose of paying such benefits, applicable provisions of Sections 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 of the Active Plan will apply. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Accrued Benefits</i>. All other RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan Accrued Benefits (not described in Section S2.1.3(a)) will be converted, as of the Effective Date, into an Actuarially Equivalent lump sum for each Participant. That lump sum will be funded from the assets that fund the Consolidated DB Plan and will be transferred as provided in Section S2.2.1(a). <br /> <CENTER><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION S2.2 &ndash; TRANSFER OF BENEFITS <br /> </b><br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S2.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transfer of Frozen Benefits.</b> Effective as soon as is practicable after the Effective Date, Participants&rsquo;, Terminated Participants&rsquo;, Beneficiaries&rsquo;, and Accountholders&rsquo; Accounts and benefits due under RSP will be transferred as provided below: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>RSP Core Defined Benefit Plan</i>. Lump sum benefits determined in accordance with Section S2.1.3(b) will be transferred to each such person&rsquo;s Final RSP Account Balance. <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan</i>. Any part of a Participant&rsquo;s or Accountholder&rsquo;s Final RSP Account Balance (both the portion arising from the RSP Core Defined Contribution Plan and the portion from Section S2.2.1(a)) that, as of the Effective Date, has not yet been distributed to the Participant or other Accountholder, whether or not such Participant or Accountholder was then entitled to a distribution of such Account Balance, will be transferred to the Active Plan in accordance with Section 4.5. <br /> (c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Imputed Earnings</i>. Any delays in making a transfer of an Accountholder&rsquo;s Final RSP Account Balance or RSP Account Balance on the day before the Effective Date beyond a reasonable time after the Effective Date will result in imputed earnings being credited in a manner similar to Sections 3.5(b) and (c) if reasonable earnings are not otherwise credited. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When, because of a Participant&rsquo;s death just before the Effective Date, or some other circumstance, a timely calculation or transfer of a Final RSP Account Balance on the day before the Effective Date is difficult or impossible, or, when such a transfer, having once been made, later appears not to have been transferred in accordance with Section S2.2.1(a), (b), or (c) in light of later-acquired information or the discovery of an administrative error, then the Administrator will make an equitable correction of the situation with the objective of complying with Section S2.2.1(a), (b), or (c), whichever appears to be applicable. None of the amounts transferred in accordance with this Section S2.2.1 will be treated as Annual Additions. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>S2.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Termination of Supplement Two.</b> When: <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all the transfers described in Section S2.2.1 are completed; and <br /> (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; all benefits are paid or are otherwise settled in accordance with Section S2.1.3(a); <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this Supplement Two will automatically terminate and become a nullity except to the extent that it is needed to: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; help specify the benefit due under another Supplement or the Active Plan; <br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cure errors in the computation or determination of benefits due under this Supplement Two or RSP; or <br /> (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accept and adjudicate a claim (or appeal) for benefits due under this Supplement Two or RSP. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></td>
