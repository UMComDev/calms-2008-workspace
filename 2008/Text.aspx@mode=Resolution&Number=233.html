<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>WORK/LEISURE <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>233. Concern for Workers Task Force <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, Scripture and Wesleyan tradition call us to do justice and demonstrate mercy for workers as an expression of our witness for Jesus Christ; <br> Whereas, transitions in the global economy and local communities have created systems and practices of unfairness and persecution of workers; and <br> Whereas, The United Methodist Church continues to need guidance and support in developing ministries of justice for workers, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved</i>, that the 2004 General Conference authorize the continuation of the Concern for Workers Task Force for the next four years. The General Conference shall direct the General Board of Global Ministries and the General Board of Church and Society to appoint a task force composed of clergy and laity. All appointees will be persons who are informed about the issues and are presently engaged in ministry to working people, the unemployed, and the underemployed. The task force will be gender, racial, and class inclusive. <br> <i>Be it further resolved</i>, that the task force shall fulfill the following goals: <br> <i>A. Educate the church about the integration of justice for workers with the Christian faith by: <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>1. providing resources and opportunities for United Methodists who are employers and directors of church-related institutions to become aware of workers&rsquo; concerns and to integrate our social teachings on workers&rsquo; rights into their vocations. The task force may organize a forum for United Methodist employers and directors for this purpose; <br> 2. providing resources and opportunities for United Methodists who are leaders of labor unions and workers&rsquo; rights organizations to integrate our social teachings on workers&rsquo; rights into their vocations. The task force may, for example, organize a forum for such persons;. <br> 3. providing resources and training for United Methodist clergy and seminarians to engage in ministry to and advocacy with workers who are engaged in labor struggles; and <br> 4. providing congregations and lay members with resources and opportunities to develop their awareness of workers&rsquo; concerns and our social teachings. <br> <i>B. Empower the church to advocate for workers&rsquo; rights in local and international struggles by: <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>1. guiding the development of the United Methodist Concern for Workers Network, through the General Boards of Church and Society and Global Ministries. The purpose of the network will be: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to help United Methodists connect with local struggles for workplace peace and justice; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to provide information about national and international campaigns and legislation that are endorsed by the General Boards of Church and Society and Global Ministries; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to promote the observance of Labor Sunday; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to receive and share information from members of the network; <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. exploring collaborations with labor unions, Pan Methodist denominations, ecumenical organizations and other workers&rsquo; rights organizations. <br> 3. assisting the General Boards in the implementation of General Conference resolutions related to the rights of workers. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000<br> Amended and REAdopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p>&nbsp; </b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>B </i>and<i> C. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
