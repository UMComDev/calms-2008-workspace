Resolution 339, Rejection of Unilateral First-Strike Actions and Strategies (adopted 2004) states:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The United Methodist Church strongly protests all unilateral first-strike actions and strategies on the part of any government or military force and calls on the President and Congress of the United States to cease and desist from such actions without ratification by, and collaboration with, the United Nations. <br /> The Constitution of the United States of America outlines specific responsibilities for Congress and the President in declaring war [and, one would think, peace]. <br />  Therefore, be it resolved that the 2008 General Conference of the United Methodist Church calls upon the President, Vice-President, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, and members of the US Senate and House of Representatives to immediately work with all deliberate speed towards peaceful resolution of issues with Iran, North Korea, countries and peoples of the Middle East, and the rest of the World, and to reject any first-strike actions by the US armed forces anywhere. Any US action must only follow full disclosure during open debate in both Houses of Congress with formal, recorded votes before any deliberate military action is taken (except for immediate self defense). The General Conference requests the General Board of Church and Society of the United Methodist Church to pursue these peace-making strategies, with particular focus on Iran and North Korea.</b><br /></p></td>
