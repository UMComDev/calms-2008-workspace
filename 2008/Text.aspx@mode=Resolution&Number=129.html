<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>129. Comity Agreements Affecting Development<br> of Native American Ministries <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, certain annual conferences of The United Methodist Church have used the alleged Comity Agreement as the basis for their functional relationship among Native Americans, limiting their capability to develop Native American ministries in certain geographical areas; and <br> Whereas, the effects of practicing the concept of a Comity Agreement by The United Methodist Church have resulted in the failure of the Church to follow through with the biblical mandate of propagating the gospel to all nations and, further, have caused the failure of the church to create the climate for leadership development of Native Americans; and <br> Whereas, such a Comity Agreement would be discriminatory in that it would violate the right of Native Americans to associate with the denomination of their choice; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church states, as a matter of policy, that it is not a party to any interdenominational agreement that limits the ability of any annual conference in any jurisdiction to develop and resource programs of ministry of any kind among Native Americans, including the organization of local churches where necessary. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1980<br> READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
