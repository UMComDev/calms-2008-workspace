(Social Principles 162C and F, 2004 Discipline) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, there are challenges faced by all children, but there are also challenges that are unique to girls.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, although girlhood should be a time of growth and learning as the girls of today develop into the women of tomorrow, for millions of girls it is a time of perilous dangers. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, girls are not valued as boys are, from the time of birth, in many societies. Girls everywhere may often have limited opportunities in education, training, and employment. In addition many face dangerous practices, such as female genital mutilation/cutting (FMG/C) and child marriage that often lead to psychological trauma, infection by sexually transmitted diseases, and frequent pregnancies, jeopardizing their health and economic well-being. Furthermore, many girls are forced into hazardous and exploitative work situations, while bearing most if not all the burden of housework at home. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b>Whereas, according to Reports from the United Nations Children&rsquo;s Fund (UNICEF) and the International Labour Organization (ILO): <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 1. Decades after commitments and reaffirmations of those commitments have been made to ensure a quality education for every child - some 117 million children &ndash; among them 62 million girls &ndash; are still denied this right. <br /> 2. The International Labour Organization estimates that 352 million or 23 % of all children between 5 and 17 years of age were economically active in the year 2000. About half of these children are estimated to do work that is likely to harm their health, safety, or moral development. <br /> 3. Given its hidden nature, it is impossible to have reliable figures on how many children are globally exploited as domestic workers. According to the ILO, though, more girl-children under 16 are in domestic service than in any other category of child labour...Common risks children face in domestic service are: long and tiring working days, use of toxic chemicals, carrying heavy loads, handling dangerous items, such as knives, axes and hot pans, insufficient or inadequate food and accommodation, and humiliating or degrading treatment, including physical and verbal violence, and sexual abuse. <br /> 4. It is estimated that more than 130 million girls and women alive today have undergone FMG/C, primarily in Africa and, to a lesser extent, in some countries in the Middle East. <br /> 5. Pregnancy related deaths are known to be a leading cause of mortality for both married and unmarried girls between the ages of 15 and 19, particularly among the youngest of this cohort. <br /> 6. Young people are at the centre of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. About half of all new HIV infections worldwide are in young people aged 15-24...Adolescent girls and young women are especially vulnerable to HIV and account for 60% of all HIV- positive young people. Of the 10 million young people living with HIV/AIDS, 6.2 million are young women and 3.9 million are young men.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, &ldquo;The achievement of goals for children, particularly for girls, will be advanced if women fully enjoy all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development, are empowered to participate fully and equally in all spheres of society and are protected and free from all forms of violence, abuse and discrimination. We are determined to eliminate all forms of discrimination against the girl child throughout her life cycle and to provide special attention to her needs in order to promote and protect all her human rights, including the right to be free from coercion...&rdquo; (&ldquo;A World Fit for Children&rdquo; United Nations)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Whereas, we have a special concern towards underserved populations, including indigenous children and children in isolated communities, The United Methodist Church has a history of supporting work with children, including girl children, through the advocacy work of the Women&rsquo;s Division, the General Board of Global Ministries and the General Board of Church and Society.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that the United Methodist Church, in accordance with the recommendations of the Report of the Expert Group meeting organized by the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women in collaboration with UNICEF, calls on local churches, conferences, general agencies, and church-related organizations, where appropriate, to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 1) Give priority and active support to the empowerment of girls in all aspects of life and include girls in the design of programs and projects to ensure that their specific needs are reflected and addressed. <br /> 2) Ensure girls&rsquo; access to youth centers and other youth-specific initiatives, including age and sex-specific spaces and activities. <br /> 3) Use the home visits that are part of health and child health initiatives to identify girls at risk of child marriage, out-of-school girls, girls living apart from their parents, and girls in other social conditions that are often associated with lack of immunization and elevated risk of sexual coercion and labor exploitation. <br /> 4) Combine social and health promotion activities within maternal and child health initiatives to prioritize reaching the youngest, first time child-brides and child mothers. <br /> 5) Develop financial literacy and microfinance (including savings and credit) programs for girls that are targeted specifically to age, sex, marital status, life cycle and context needs. <br /> 6) Develop strategies and action plans to build girls&rsquo; stakes in their societies and to recognize and acknowledge their rights and citizenship at an earlier age, ideally close to puberty when specific risks often undermine the rights of adolescent girls. <br />  7) Support public education programs and spaces for girls to, for example, carry out national level consultations, essay contests, and national media events that include the voices of girls and boys in questioning gender inequalities.</b><br /></p></td>
