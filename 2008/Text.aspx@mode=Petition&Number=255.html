There <strike> may</strike>&nbsp; <b>shall</b> be a jurisdictional <strike> young adult<b> </strike> young adult ministry </b>organization for the purpose of networking young adults throughout the region, supporting <strike> young adult <b></strike> young adult</b> ministries in the annual conferences, and supporting <strike> young adult</strike>&nbsp;young adult workers in their ministry. <b>There shall be a jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation to be held at least once every other year in each jurisdiction (not in the same year as the Global Young People&rsquo;s Convocation). The jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation may be held in conjunction with the jurisdictional youth ministry organization convocation (¶531). Among the membership of the convocation there shall be four voting representatives from each conference: the conference coordinator of young adult ministries or designate; the conference council on young adult ministry chairperson or designate; two young adults at large, to be elected as shall be determined by the conference council on young adult ministry. It is recommended that at least two members from each annual conference be racial and ethnic persons. Each young adult shall be a professing member of The United Methodist Church. Other persons may be added by jurisdictions according to their respective operational guidelines, provided that the above categories are cared for and the recommended fifty-fifty representation of racial and ethnic persons is observed. The expenses of the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation may be borne by the participating annual conferences or the jurisdiction. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> There shall be a jurisdictional young adult ministry coordinator who shall be accountable to the jurisdictional council on ministries or equivalent structure and the jurisdictional young adult organization. This coordinator may or may not be the same person as the jurisdictional youth ministry coordinator. This coordinator may or may not be the same person as the adult representative to the Division on Ministries with Young People of the General Board of Discipleship. This decision is to be determined by the representatives of the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation, or the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> A responsibility of the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation shall be to elect one young adult member to the Division on Ministries with Young People of the General Board of Discipleship for four-year terms. Nominations shall come from annual conference councils on young adult ministry or equivalent structure. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The nominating process followed by the conference councils on young adult ministry shall include the solicitation of nominations from local churches, sub-districts, and districts. As far as possible, members of the Division on Ministries&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with Young People from each jurisdiction shall be from different annual conferences in that jurisdiction with attention to racial and ethnic inclusivity.<u> </u><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> In the year prior to the Global Young People&rsquo;s Convocation, the jurisdictional&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;young adult ministry organization shall also elect five young adults and one adult as voting delegates to the Global Young People&rsquo;s Convocation. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> In addition to enabling the election of its division members and the election of the delegates to the Global Young People&rsquo;s Convocation, the following are suggested responsibilities for the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization: <br /> 1. To initiate and support jurisdictional events (camps, conferences, workshops, and so forth); <br /> 2. To recommend priorities, concerns, and/or policies to the Division on Ministries with Young People; <br /> 3. To promote the establishment and awareness of the needs, concerns, issues, and so forth of racial and ethnic persons through caucuses, camps, consultations, and so forth; <br /> 4. To promote the spiritual growth of participants in the jurisdictional young adult ministry organization convocation; <br /> 5. To promote an evangelistic outreach to and through young adults; <br /> 6. To provide training and supportive experiences for conference young adult personnel; <br /> 7. To enable communication between general and conference levels of young adult ministry; <br />  8. To elect a steering committee or executive body to carry out the functions and suggested responsibilities of the convocation during the interval between convocations. The convocation shall determine the representation of such body, the manner of election, any funding thereof, and the relationship of the body to the annual conferences and to the jurisdictional council on ministries or equivalent.</b><br /></p></td>
