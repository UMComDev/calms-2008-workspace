Dismissal of Complaint&mdash;The committee, with the affirmative vote of at least five members, may dismiss the complaint without holding a hearing and provide a written report to the Council of Bishops summarizing its findings and reasons for dismissal.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Complaints Procedure&mdash;If the complaint is not dismissed, the committee shall hold a hearing on the matter at which the complainant and the respondent shall be entitled to be present.&nbsp;&nbsp;The respondent may be accompanied by a person of his/her own choosing who will have the privilege of voice.&nbsp;&nbsp;The complainant may be likewise accompanied.&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall make findings of fact and decide upon what action(s) to apply to the member.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the committee&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> recommends dismissal from the Judicial Council, that action shall require at least five votes.&nbsp;&nbsp;All lesser actions shall require a simple majority.&nbsp;&nbsp;The committee shall issue a written report of its&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> investigation and its findings and a statement of its action(s) to the full Council of Bishops.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision shall be made public. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeals&mdash;The respondent may appeal the decision of the Committee on Judicial Conduct to the full Council of Bishops.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chair of the committee shall present at that time its findings of fact, decision and actions to the Council of Bishops.&nbsp;&nbsp;The accused member and the complainant shall have the privilege of addressing the Council of Bishops.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Council of Bishops, by a majority vote, may sustain or modify the rulings of the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;Its decision shall be final.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>There is no provision in the Book of Discipline for removal of a member of the Judicial Council for incapacity or inappropriate behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in contrast to how we hold others accountable at every level of the Church. <br /> <br /></p></td>
