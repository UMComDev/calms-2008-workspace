When Christ began his public ministry, he proclaimed that he was anointed to bring good news to the poor and to free the oppressed (Luke 4:18).&nbsp;&nbsp;Following the warnings of the prophets and the teachings of Christ, The United Methodist Church remains committed to a ministry of economic justice. </b><br /> <b>Today&rsquo;s economy is too often biased towards profits rather than the common good.&nbsp;&nbsp;As participants in this economy, consumers have power to perpetuate or challenge this bias. As Christian consumers, we are called, through individual and collective actions, to ensure that our participation in the economic system is valuing people and perpetuating justice, rather than simply maximizing profits.&nbsp;&nbsp;One effective mechanism to challenge injustice and to reclaim this often-overlooked power is an economic boycott. </b><br /> Preamble&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> An economic boycott is understood to be a combined effort to abstain from the purchase or use of products or services provided by a <b>specific </b><strike> targeted firm<b></strike> company</b>, government, or other agency. The purpose of a boycott is to persuade th<strike> e targeted <b></strike> at </b>body to cease from certain practices judged to be unjust, and/or to perform certain practices deemed to be just. Acknowledging the boycott as a legitimate Christian response to an identified social or economic injustice, we recommend the following criteria as a process for guiding the church and its agencies in decisions regarding boycott. This process includes the following steps:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strike><ul><li> preparation<b></strike> Preparation </b><br /> <ul><li><b>D</b><strike> d</strike> ecision making&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <ul><li><b>M</b><strike> m</strike> onitoring&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><li><b>S</b><strike> s</strike> uspension/termination&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>The process and steps outlined in this resolution are intended as a guide for discernment and action for those exploring the option of an economic boycott, not an exhaustive or mandated checklist required prior to action.&nbsp;&nbsp;The decision-making body, however, should document and distribute widely relevant information including the theological and factual underpinnings of its decision. </b><i><strike> The decision-making body shall designate those persons who will perform the tasks of each step. The twelve criteria are the minimal concerns to be addressed as a decision-making body secures information and data upon which to determine its action. The questions following the criteria statements are not part of the criteria but are given to help a decision-making body address specific areas of concern and secure information that will assist in its decision. </i></strike> <br /> <i><strike> The gathered information and data are to be written and distributed to the decision-making body. </strike> Clarifying Who May Call </i><br /> Any local church, district, annual conference, or general church board or agency <strike> shall be able to <b></strike>&nbsp;can initiate or </b>join a boycott if it <b>has completed or </b>ascertains that another part of The United Methodist Church, or an ecumenical agency that the church is a member of, has completed the initiation process described below. Any of the above may request the General Conference to join it in the boycott in the name of The United Methodist Church. Only the General Conference shall be empowered to initiate a boycott in the name of The United Methodist Church. <strike> It <b></strike>&nbsp;The originating body </b><strike> shall designate<b></strike>&nbsp;is responsible</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility </strike> for monitoring and suspending and/or terminating such a boycott.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Preparation </i><br /> I.

How will a boycott affect a potential resolution of the situation?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 4.
