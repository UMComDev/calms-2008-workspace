<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>301. United States-China Political Relations <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER></b><i>Our Political Understandings <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>In late 1978, the governments of the United States and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China (PRC) reached agreement establishing full diplomatic relations. The United States ended official relations-diplomatic and military-with the authorities on Taiwan. (In March 1979, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, putting U.S. relations with Taiwan on an unofficial basis.) The United States recognized the People&rsquo;s Republic of China as the &ldquo;sole legal government of China&rdquo; but reserved the right, over PRC objections, to sell &ldquo;defensive&rdquo; weapons to Taiwan. At the time of normalization, the PRC refused to rule out the possibility of reunifying with the island of Taiwan by force but offered to allow Taiwan to maintain the political, economic, and military status quo if Taiwan were to recognize PRC sovereignty. <br> This normalization agreement ended a thirty-year period in which formal American commitments to the authorities on Taiwan blocked closer relations with the People&rsquo;s Republic of China. It laid the foundations for a framework of cooperation and exchanges that continues to develop. Highlights include: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>government-to-government agreements covering consular relations and embassies, civil aviation, scientific and technical cooperation, educational exchange, trade and credit, fisheries, and a wide range of other fields; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> substantial expansion of tourism and specialized visits; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> educational programs facilitating nearly 10,500 scholars and teachers (10,000 Chinese, 500 Americans) to be resident in the other country; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> numerous governmental and private institutional exchange agreements in education, the fine and performing arts, cinema, publishing, and so forth; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> sister state-province and city-to-city agreements calling for various kinds of cooperation. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rapid growth and elaboration of these bilateral relations has been unusual and, to many, unexpected. While the direction is generally positive and the initial results heartening, the relationship is still in its early stages. Because the PRC and U.S. systems are so different, translating worthwhile goals into concrete practice has often been difficult. <br> Fundamentally, the two countries have yet to determine what kind of long-term relationship they want. Misperceptions and misunderstandings are all too common on both sides, even on basic principles. <br> As a case in point, the two sides had sharp disagreements during 1981 and 1982 over the issue of continuing U.S. arms sales to Taiwan. By August 1982, Washington and Beijing had clarified their understanding on this question: The PRC stated that its &ldquo;fundamental policy&rdquo; was to &ldquo;strive for peaceful reunification&rdquo; with Taiwan. In that context, the U.S. government pledged not to increase and in fact to reduce its sale of arms to Taiwan. But this agreement only holds in abeyance a resolution of the Taiwan issue. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Recommendations on U.S.-China Political Relations <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The United Methodist Church: <br> 1. recognizes the necessity for China to continue its economic and social development and urges U.S. cooperation to that end within the context of Chinese independence and selfhood; <br> 2. feels the long-term basis of U.S.-China relations should emphasize people-to-people, educational, social, and economic short-term or expedient military or strategic interests; opposes the sale of U.S. military equipment to the PRC; <br> 3. endorses a peaceful approach to ending the long-standing conflict between the governments in the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and in Taiwan while recognizing that the resolution of the status of Taiwan is a matter for the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and for Taiwan and in that context supports the continued reduction and early cessation of U.S. arms sales in Taiwan; <br> 4. declares our continuing concern regarding the human rights of all people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits; and <br> 5. recognizes that U.S.-PRC relations have an important influence on the peace and stability of the Asian region, particularly in Southeast Asia; and urges the United States and the People&rsquo;s Republic of China and Taiwan to seek peaceful means to contribute to the peace and stability of the region. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1984<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165<i>C</i> and <i>D</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
