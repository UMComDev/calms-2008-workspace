The Judicial Council shall pass upon and affirm, modify, or reverse the decisions of law made by bishops in central, district, annual, or jurisdictional conferences upon questions of law submitted to them in writing in the regular business of a session; and in order to facilitate such review, each bishop shall report annually in writing to the Judicial Council on forms provided by the council all the bishop's decisions of law. No such episcopal decision shall be authoritative, except in the case pending, until it has been passed upon by the Judicial Council, but thereafter it shall become the law of the Church to the extent that it is affirmed by the council. Normally, the bishop shall rule before the close of the annual conference session during which the question was submitted, but in no case later than thirty days after the close of the session. The annual conference secretary shall enter in the annual conference journal an exact statement of the question submitted and the ruling of the bishop.6&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>To resolve differences of opinion between conference members and the bishop or other members of church leadership on the way Disciplinary processes were used to resolve issues related to the Business of the Annual Conference (see Paragraph 605.6) for the clergy session</b>,<b> questions of law shall be answered by the Judicial Council unless the questions fail to relate to a specific pastor and how the Disciplinary processes were used in a specific case (&ldquo;hypothetical&rdquo;) or whose case could come to the Judicial Council by way of appeal of a church trial (&ldquo;moot&rdquo;).<br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>In JCD 1031, the Judicial Council rightly laid aside use of &ldquo;moot and hypothetical&rdquo; justification for refusing to deal with cases brought to them under P 2609.6.&nbsp;&nbsp;They correctly overturned actions that were outside of the Discipline and they enforced Church law by ruling as they should.<br /></p></td>
