Countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean owe over $2 trillion to rich nations and international financial institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The poorest countries in the world are the most heavily indebted, owing around $370 billion. For many countries, the burden of repaying the debt has prevented them from providing adequate health care, education, and food for the masses. This debt burden inhibits the social and economic development that is needed to lift people out of poverty. Throughout the world there is a call for Jubilee, a call for debt cancellation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </strike></strike></strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Since the inception of the global Jubilee Campaign in 2000, we can celebrate important strides. The debt of twenty nations to the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank has been wiped out, with the proceeds going to fight poverty in these nations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite this important step, the global debt crisis continues to cripple poor countries. Countries in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, Latin America, and the Caribbean still owe over $2 trillion to rich nations and international financial institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The poorest countries in the world are still among the most heavily indebted, owing around $380 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;For too many countries left behind by world leaders, the burden of repaying the debt continues to prevent them from providing adequate health care, education, and food for their people.&nbsp;&nbsp;This debt burden &ndash; often incurred illegitimately by dictators &ndash; inhibits the social and economic change that is needed to lift people out of poverty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout the world there is still a call for Jubilee, a call for debt cancellation in a Sabbath Year. </b><br /> </b></b><br /> II. Biblical Foundation<b> (No changes) </b><br /> <br /> III. Causes of the Debt Crisis <br /> <b> (New paragraphs after last paragraph) Today, debt campaigners across the globe are increasingly focused on the origins of much of the debt of countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.&nbsp;&nbsp;Campaigners in these regions are questioning whether much of the debt is really owed.&nbsp;&nbsp;A growing number of governments are undertaking official audits to assess the legitimacy of debts. Debts are odious if they result from loans <strike> contracts </strike> contracted without the knowledge or consent of the population or if <strike> the </strike> government officials used the money for personal purposes or to oppress their people. In cases where borrowed money was used in ways contrary to the peoples&rsquo; interest, with the knowledge of the creditors, the creditors may be said to have committed a hostile act against the people. Creditors cannot legitimately expect repayment of such debts.&nbsp;&nbsp;Examples of odious debt are money from loans stolen by the ruling elite of the then Indonesia dictator Suharto; debts contracted y the apartheid regime of South Africa; and debts accrued during the dictatorial rule of Mobbutu Sese Seko in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ferdinand Marcos in the Philippines and the military junta in Argentina. </b><br /> IV. Consequences of the Global Crisis&mdash;Everyone Loses <b>(No Changes)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /> V. Principles to Guide Debt-Crisis Solutions <b>(No Changes) </b><br /> VI. Recommended Actions for The United Methodist Church&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The United Methodist Church, as a covenant community committed to Christian discipleship and advocacy with the poor, must work toward "measures that would reduce the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few" (Â¶ <strike> 67<b></strike>&nbsp;163</b>, <strike> 1996 <b></strike> 2004 </b>Discipline).
