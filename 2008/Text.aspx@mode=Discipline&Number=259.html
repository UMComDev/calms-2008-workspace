<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">Administrative Committees <br>¶ <b>259.</b> 1.<b> </b>There shall be elected annually, by the charge conference in each local church, a <b>committee on lay leadership</b> that is composed of professing members of the local church. The charge of this committee is to identify, develop, deploy, evaluate, and monitor Christian spiritual leadership for the local congregation. Members of the committee shall engage in and be attentive to developing and enhancing their own Christian spiritual life in light of the mission of the Church (Part V, Chapter One, Section 1). <br> In conducting its work, the committee shall engage in biblical and theological reflections on the mission of the church, the primary task, and ministries of the local church. It shall provide a means of identifying the spiritual gifts and abilities of the membership. The committee shall work with the church council, or alternative administrative bodies, to determine the diverse ministry tasks of<i> </i>the congregation<i> </i>and the skills needed for leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a</i>) The committee on lay leadership shall serve throughout the year to guide the church council, or alternative structure, on matters regarding the leadership (other than employed staff) of the congregation so as to focus on mission and ministry as the context for service; guide the development and training of spiritual leaders; recruit, nurture, and support spiritual leaders; and assist the church council, or alternative structure, in assessing the changing leadership needs. <br> <i>b</i>) The committee shall recommend to the charge conference, at its annual session, the names of people to serve as officers and leaders of designated ministries of the church council, or alternative administrative body required for the work of the church and as the law of the church requires or as the charge conference deems necessary to its work. <br> <i>c</i>) This committee is to be composed of not more than nine persons, in addition to the pastor and the lay leader. At least one young adult elected by the charge conference shall serve as a member of the committee. One or more members elected by the charge conference may be youth. The pastor shall be the chairperson. A layperson elected by the committee on lay leadership shall serve as the vice chairperson of the committee. <br> <i>d</i>) In order to secure experience and stability, the membership shall be divided into three classes, one of which shall be elected each year for a three-year term. To begin the process of rotation where such has not been in place, in the first year, one class shall be elected for one year, one class for two years, and one class for three years. Each year&rsquo;s new class, and vacancies at the time of charge conference, shall be elected from nominees, from the floor of the charge conference and/or through the recommendation of the committee on lay leadership. Retiring members of the committee shall not succeed themselves. Only one person from an immediate family residing in the same household<i> </i>shall serve on the committee. When vacancies occur during the year, nominees shall be elected by the church council, or alternative church structure,<i> </i>with the permission of the district superintendent. <br> <i>e</i>) In the identification and selection process, care shall be given that the leadership of ministries reflects inclusivity and diversity<i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>2. There shall be elected annually by the charge conference in each local church a <b>committee on pastor-parish relations or staff-parish relations</b> who are professing members of the local church or charge or associate members (¶ 227), except in cases where central conference legislation or local law provides otherwise. People serving on this committee must be engaged in and attentive to their Christian spiritual development so as to give proper leadership in the responsibilities with which the committee is entrusted. <br> In conducting its work, the committee shall identify and clarify its values for ministry. It shall engage in biblical and theological reflections on the mission of the church, the primary task, and ministries of the local church.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The committee shall reflect biblically and theologically on the role and work of the pastor(s) and staff as they carry out their leadership responsibilities. The committee shall assist the pastor(s) and staff in assessing their gifts and setting priorities for leadership and service. It is the responsibility of the committee to communicate with the committee on lay leadership and/or the church council when there is a need for other leaders or for employed staff to perform in areas where utilization of the gifts of the pastor(s) and staff proves an inappropriate stewardship of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a</i>) The committee shall be composed of not fewer than five nor more than nine persons representative of the total charge. One of the members shall be a young adult and one member may be a youth. In addition, the lay leader and a lay member of the annual conference shall be members. No staff member or immediate family member of a pastor or staff member may serve on the committee. Only one person from an immediate family residing in the same household shall serve on the committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>b</i>) In order to secure experience and stability, the membership shall be divided into three classes, one of which shall be elected each year for a three-year term. The lay member<i> </i>of the annual conference and the lay leader are exempt from the three-year term. To begin the process of rotation where such a process has not been in place, on the first year one class shall be elected for one year, one class for two years, and one class for three years. Retiring members of the committee shall not succeed themselves. When vacancies occur during the year, nominees shall be elected at the church council (or alternative church structure). <br> <i>c)</i> In those charges where there is more than one church, the committee shall include at least one representative from each local church. <br> <i>d)</i> The committees on pastor-parish relations of charges that are in cooperative parish ministries shall meet together to consider the professional leadership needs of the cooperative parish ministry as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>e)</i> The committee shall meet at least quarterly. It shall meet additionally at the request of the bishop, the district superintendent, the pastor, any other person accountable to the committee, or the chairperson of the committee. To fulfill his or her obligation under ordination, his or her connectional responsibility under appointment, and his or her duty as a pastor, the pastor should be present at each meeting of the committee on pastor-parish relations or staff-parish relations except where he or she voluntarily excuses himself or herself. The committee shall meet only with the knowledge of the pastor and/or the district superintendent. It may meet with the district superintendent without the pastor being present. However, the pastor or any member of the staff under consideration shall be notified prior to such meeting at which a pastor&rsquo;s or clergy staff member&rsquo;s continued appointment or a lay staff member&rsquo;s employment is discussed and be brought into consultation immediately thereafter. The committee shall meet in closed session, and information shared in the committee shall be confidential. <br> <i>f)</i> In the event that only one congregation on a charge containing more than one church has concerns it wishes to share, its member(s) in the committee may meet separately with the pastor or any other person accountable to the committee or the district superintendent, but only with the knowledge of the pastor and/or district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>g) </i>The duties of the committee shall include the following: <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) To encourage, strengthen, nurture, support, and respect the pastor(s) and staff and their family(s). <br> (2) To promote unity in the church(es). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) To confer with and counsel the pastor(s) and staff on the matters pertaining to the effectiveness of ministry; relationships with the congregation; conditions that may impede the effectiveness of ministry; and to interpret the nature and function of the ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) To confer with, consult, and counsel the pastor(s) and staff on matters pertaining to priorities in the use of gifts, skills, and time and priorities for the demands and effectiveness of the mission and ministry of the congregation. <br> (5) To provide evaluation at least annually for the use of the pastor(s) and staff in an ongoing effective ministry and for identifying continuing educational needs and plans. <br> (6) To communicate and interpret to the congregation the nature and function of ministry in The United Methodist Church regarding open itinerancy, the preparation for ordained ministry, and the Ministerial Education Fund. <br> (7) To develop and approve written job descriptions and titles for associate pastors and other staff members in cooperation with the senior pastor. The term <i>associate pastor</i> is used as a general term to indicate any pastoral appointment in a local church other than the pastor in charge (<i>see</i> ¶ 339). Committees shall be encouraged to develop specific titles for associate pastors that reflect the job descriptions and expectations. <br> (8) To consult with the pastor and staff concerning continuing education and spiritual renewal, to arrange with the church council for the necessary time and financial assistance for the attendance of the pastor and/or staff at such continuing education and spiritual renewal events as may serve their professional and spiritual growth, and to encourage staff members to seek professional certification in their fields of specialization. <br> (9) To enlist, interview, evaluate, review, and recommend annually to the charge conference lay preachers and persons for candidacy for ordained ministry (<i>see</i> ¶¶ 247.8 and 310), and to enlist and refer to the General Board of Global Ministries persons for candidacy for missionary service, recognizing that The United Methodist Church affirms the biblical and theological support of persons regardless of gender, race, ethnic origin, or disabilities for these ministries. Neither the pastor nor any member of the committee on pastor-parish<br> relations shall be present during the consideration of a candidacy application or renewal for a member of their immediate family.<b> </b>The committee shall provide to the charge conference a list of students from the charge who are preparing for ordained ministry, diaconal ministry, and/or missionary service, and shall maintain contact with these students, supplying the charge conference with a progress report on each student. <br> (10) To interpret preparation for ordained ministry and the Ministerial Education Fund to the congregation. <br> (11) To confer with the pastor and/or other appointed members of the staff if it should become evident that the best interests of the charge and pastor(s) will be served by a change of pastor(s). The committee shall cooperate with the pastor(s), the district superintendent, and the bishop in securing clergy leadership. Its relationship to<br> the district superintendent and the bishop shall be advisory only.</sub><sup>9</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;(<i>See</i> ¶¶&nbsp;430-433.) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(12) To recommend to the church council, after consultation with the pastor, the professional and other staff positions (whether employee or contract) needed to carry out the work of the church or charge. The committee and the pastor shall recommend to the church council a written statement of policy and procedures regarding the process for hiring, contracting, evaluating, promoting, retiring, and dismissing staff personnel who are not subject to episcopal appointment as ordained clergy. Until such a policy has been adopted, the committee and the pastor shall have the authority to hire, contract, evaluate, promote, retire, and dismiss nonappointed personnel. When persons are hired or contracted, consideration shall be given to the training qualifications and certification standards set forth by the general Church agency to which such positions are related. The committee shall further recommend to the church council a provision for adequate health and life insurance and severance pay for all lay employees. In addition, the committee shall recommend that the church council provide, effective on and after January 1, 2006, 100 percent vested pension benefits of at least three percent of compensation for lay employees of the local church who work at least 1040 hours per year, are at least 21 years of age, and have at least one year of permanent service. The church council shall have authority to provide such pension benefits through either a denominational pension program administered by the General Board of Pension and Health Benefits or another pension program administered by another pension provider. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(13) To recommend to the charge conference, when the size of the employed staff of the charge makes it desirable, the establishment of a <b>personnel committee.</b> This committee shall be composed of such members of the committee on pastor-parish relations as it may designate and such additional members as the charge conference may determine.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> (14) To educate the church community on the value of diversity of selection in clergy and lay staff and develop a commitment to same. <br> (15) Members of the committee on pastor-parish relations (or staff-parish relations) shall keep themselves informed of personnel matters in relationship to the Church&rsquo;s policy, professional standards, liability issues, and civil law. They are responsible for communicating and interpreting such matters to staff. Committee members should make themselves available for educational and training opportunities provided by the conference, district, and/or other arenas that will enable them to be effective in their work. <br> (16) To consult on matters pertaining to pulpit supply, proposals for compensation, travel expense, vacation, health and life insurance, pension, housing (which may be a church-owned parsonage or housing allowance in lieu of parsonage if in compliance with the policy of the annual conference), and other practical matters affecting the work and families of the pastor and staff, and to make annual recommendations regarding such matters to the church council, reporting budget items to the committee on finance. The parsonage is to be mutually respected by the pastor&rsquo;s family as the property of the church and by the church as a place of privacy for the pastor&rsquo;s family. The chairperson of the committee on pastor-parish relations, the chairperson of the board of trustees, and the pastor shall make an annual review of the church-owned parsonage to assure proper maintenance. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;3.

It is recommended that the chairperson of the committee on finance shall be a member of the church council. The financial secretary, treasurer, and church business administrator, if paid employees, shall be members without vote. <br> The positions of treasurer and financial secretary should not be combined and held by one person, and the persons holding these two positions should not be immediate family members. <br> Where there is no stewardship ministry area, stewardship shall be the responsibility of a subgroup of the committee on finance or shall be assigned to a task group that shall report to the church council. <br> All financial askings to be included in the annual budget of the local church shall be submitted to the committee on finance. The committee on finance shall compile annually a complete budget for the local church and submit it to the church council for review and adoption. The committee on finance shall be charged with responsibility for developing and implementing plans that will raise sufficient income to meet the budget adopted by the church council.
