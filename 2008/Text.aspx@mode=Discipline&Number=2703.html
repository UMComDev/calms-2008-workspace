The committee on investigation shall elect a chair and organize at the annual conference. None of the members or alternates shall be members of the board of ordained ministry, the cabinet, or immediate family members of the above.

Seven members or alternates seated as members of the committee shall constitute a quorum.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 3. <i>When respondent is a diaconal minister</i>-In all cases, the pastor, district superintendent or bishop should take supervisory steps to resolve any grievances or complaints.
