(2) No bishop shall be transferred unless that bishop shall have specifically consented.&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) No bishop shall be eligible for transfer unless the bishop shall have served one quadrennium in the jurisdiction that elected the bishop to the episcopacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) All such transfers shall require the approval by a majority vote of the members present and voting of the jurisdictional committees on episcopacy of the jurisdictions that are involved.&nbsp;&nbsp;After the above procedures have been followed, the transferring bishop shall become a member of the receiving College of Bishops and shall be subject to residential assignment by that jurisdictional conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;A bishop may be assigned by the Council of Bishops for presidential service or other temporary service in another jurisdiction than that which elected the bishop; <i>provided</i> that the request is made by a majority of the bishops in the jurisdiction of the proposed service. <br /> In the case of an emergency in any jurisdiction or <strike> central<b></strike>&nbsp;regional</b> conference through the death or disability of a bishop or other cause, the Council of Bishops may assign a bishop from another jurisdiction or <strike> central</strike>&nbsp; <b>regional </b>conference to the work of the said jurisdiction or <strike> central</strike>&nbsp; <b>regional </b>conference, with the consent of a majority of the bishops of that jurisdiction or <strike> central</strike>&nbsp; <b>regional</b> conference. (The change in name from &ldquo;central&rdquo; to &ldquo;regional&rdquo; takes effect January 1, 2013 at which time this parenthetical procedural note will be removed from the Constitution.) <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>General Conference should be able to create similar structures for all of our world-wide church. Each Annual Conference should belong to a Regional Conference which should be able to organize sub-units called Jurisdictional Conferences. Further study is needed to explore how to live more fully into our world-wide nature. <br /> <br /></p></td>
