Students often find their place and spirituality within these ministries, substituting time spent in fellowship with peers for time spent in a formal worship setting. Often times, these fellowships serve as an introduction to the church and as settings for affirmation of faith. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Whereas</i>, many people find their faith, change their faith, and challenge their faith during their formative young adult years, it is important to have a presence to answer questions and attract seekers. We believe The United Methodist Church is a strong spiritual home with a table open to any who want to participate. Through campus ministries, students are given the chance to find their &ldquo;home&rdquo; in our church; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Whereas</i>, as representatives from campuses across the country, we embrace common challenges found today and envision ways to work with annual conferences to strengthen our ministries; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Whereas</i>, the common challenges of campus ministries include: <br /> A rapid turnover of population <br /> An inability to be self-sustaining through the traditional parish methods of tithing and lay leadership; <br /> A disconnection in the transfer between high school and college fellowships <br /> Ministers who face unique challenges outside that of parish churches: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Whereas</i>, we see a higher percentage of young adults attending college, demanding a proportional increase in campus ministry support: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Whereas</i>, many universities are the size of small cities, the same size as other population centers where we maintain a United Methodist presence: <br /> <i>Therefore, be it resolved</i>, that we see a growing importance for campus ministries within the church. The 2008 General Conference affirms the work of our campus ministries. With the support of annual conferences across the nation, we envision a growing body of young adults with an increased presence and place in The United Methodist Church. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Be it further resolved</i>, that we ask annual conferences to: <br /> - acknowledge the unique challenges we face&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> - support their campus ministry programs and campus ministers <br /> - help high school graduates and young adults connect with campus ministries.</b><br /></b></b></i></i></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Campus ministers are essential to connecting the church with college students, a group sometimes excluded from local congregations, and need support to continue this vital ministry from annual conferences and local congregations.<br /></p></td>
