<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>183. Expressing Grief for Acts of Violence <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, violence permeates our society, perpetrated by those who hurt others because of the color of their skin, their sexual orientation, their religious identity, or no reason at all; and <br> Whereas, violence exists in many nations including but not limited to Northern Ireland, the former Yugoslavia, Israel, Palestinian-controlled territories, Iraq, Liberia, Myanmar, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sudan, West Timor, and the Russian federation where &ldquo;ethnic cleansing,&rdquo; deportations, tyrannical rulers, religious intolerance, war, and civil unrest scar the lives of millions and have resulted in despicable acts of murder and genocide; and <br> Whereas, The United Methodist Church grieves over this violence; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church be in ministry to our grieving communities. Our congregations shall include avenues for young people to share joys, concerns, fears, and aspirations in a violence-free environment. Our Council of Bishops shall express a voice of hope for our nation, working with members of Congress, the President, and state governments to support funding for programming that gives youth alternatives to violence and criminal activity. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that United Methodist congregations, youth and campus ministries and church agencies promote opportunities where we may be a witness to a grieving nation, helping to heal wounds of violence in our communities, witnessing through work groups, Bible studies, community outreach, prayer and involvement in ecumenical and interfaith groups and coalitions. <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that the United Methodist Council of Bishops and the leaders of our pan-Methodist family express a voice of hope for those who suffer from violence throughout the world community, and that the bishops act as beacons of light, working with the United Nations and leaders of national states to bring about more peace and justice in our global community. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that we as United Methodists and individuals within the global community seek to reconcile the violence found within our own hearts, seek forgiveness for the injustices we ourselves have committed to each other, our friends and family, and the larger community. Whether it be our actions or our thoughts, our words or our deeds, our voice or our silence, if we have done wrong, we seek forgiveness. We pray for mercy as we seek to walk more humbly with our God, with our families and friends, with our communities, and with ourselves. <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that we United Methodists express our grief for the broken covenants of the church, both in The United Methodist Church and the church universal; we define a broken covenant as being actions that we may have committed in the name of faith that have locked persons out of relationships with Jesus Christ and the church, whether it be because of differences, prejudices, or through ignorance. We seek forgiveness for acts of violence committed in the name of faith. <br> We accept the call of our living God as presented in Scripture, in Micah 6:8, where God&rsquo;s requirements are presented: &ldquo;He has shown you, O man, what is good. And what does the Lord require of you? To do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.&rdquo; As we grieve we know that Jesus Christ calls us to rise up and to minister to a broken community that it may heal and that we may one day live in a community free from violence. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
