The day is to recognize and celebrate the gifts, talents, and contributions older adults make within and beyond the local church. The day should also provide congregations with the opportunity to learn more about the issues and concerns related to aging and older adulthood. The Committee on Older Adult Ministries will have responsibility for the supervision and promotion of the observance of this special day. </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Spirituality is key to a vital old age; aging is often called a spiritual journey. Because the Committee on Older Adult Ministries believes that congregations should recognize, encourage, equip, and support the gifts and service of its oldest members, it proposes intentional acts of recognition for older adults in ministry.<br /></p></td>
