This includes promoting the professional and para-professional certification in Christian education, youth ministry, spiritual formation, camping and retreat ministry and older adult ministry, and, where appropriate, monitoring all approved seminary M.Div. programs to ensure that future leaders are being trained in the ministries of Christian education.</b><br /></p></td>
