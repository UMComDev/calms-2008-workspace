United Nations Resolutions on the Israel-Palestine Conflict <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, negotiations between the State of Israel and the Palestinian National Authority still have not achieved a just and lasting peace for the Palestinian people; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the United Nations Security Council <b>and General Assembly </b><strike> has</strike>&nbsp; <b>have </b>passed numerous resolutions <b>since UN Resolution 181, the Partition Plan, first adopted in November 1947</b>, including Resolutions 242 and 338, that outline a framework for a just and lasting peace; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the UMC <b>in the Social Principles </b>recognizes and affirms the role of the United Nations in the <b>just and lasting </b>resolution of <strike> this </strike> conflict<b>, &ldquo;Believing that international justice requires the participation of all peoples, we endorse the United Nations and its related bodies and the International Court of Justice as the best instruments now in existence to achieve a world of justice and law.&rdquo; (¶ 165D)</b> <strike> and has already affirmed that</strike>&nbsp; <strike> the "principles embodied in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 provide an agreed upon formula to achieve security and peace for all states in the area" (see "The Current Arab-Israeli Crisis")</strike> , <b>and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, Security Council resolution 242, unanimously adopted in 1967, declares</b>, <b>&ldquo;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war and the need to work for a just and lasting peace in which every State in the area can live in security&rdquo; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the security of every state depends on it having defined borders and not occupying the territory of its neighbors, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the 10</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;commandment in the Bible states, &ldquo;You shall not covet your neighbor&rsquo;s house...or anything that belongs to your neighbor&rdquo; (Exodus 20:17), and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, for more than 40 years the government of Israel has continued its military occupation of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza and the seizing of more and more Palestinian land for illegal settlements in direct violation of UN resolutions as well as United Methodist General Conference resolutions, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the International Court of Justice, on July 9, 2004, issued an advisory opinion which declared: that Israel&rsquo;s security barrier or wall built on occupied Palestinian territories violates international law; that it must be dismantled; and that compensation must be provided to Palestinians for loss of land and livelihood, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, Israel&rsquo;s government has continued to build the wall on Palestinian land in ongoing violation of international law which greatly increases Palestinian suffering as well as heightens the insecurity of both Palestinians and Israelis, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, May 2008 marks 60 years since the establishment of the state of Israel as well as the dispossession of 750,000-900,000 Palestinians who are still seeking their full human rights, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, ongoing military occupation and armed resistance heightens violence and insecurity for Palestinians and Israelis alike, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the United Methodist Church opposes all violence against civilians and considers &ldquo;war is incompatible with the teachings and example of Christ&rdquo; (Social Principles 165C), and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the United States&rsquo; use of its veto more than 30 times in the UN Security Council to block actions by the international community to criticize and prevent the killing of Palestinian civilians has contributed to a climate of impunity and exacerbated the cycle of violence effecting both Palestinians and Israelis,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Therefore, be it resolved, that The United Methodist Church <b>calls upon Israel, the Palestinian National Authority and all states to abide by, and uphold UN resolutions, International Court of Justice rulings, and international law as the basis for just and lasting peace in Palestine/Israel,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Be it further resolved, that The United Methodist Church call upon </b>the United States, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, to accept the authority of Security Council resolutions<b>, to refrain from vetoing resolutions,</b> and abide by <b>Security Council </b>Resolutions 242 and 338, as well as all other relevant <strike> Security Council</strike>&nbsp; <b>UN </b>resolutions <b>and International Court of Justice rulings</b>, that provide a framework for bringing this conflict to a just and permanent end. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> ADOPTED 2000 <br /> See Social Principles, ¶ 165A, B, C, and D.<br /></p></td>
