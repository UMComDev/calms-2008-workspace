Bush issued two Presidential Proclamations recalling the sacrifice, courage, and loyalty of Filipino veterans of World War II; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the United States Congress passed two resolutions in 1996 and 2005 that recognized and thanked the Filipino veterans of World War II for their service and contribution toward the successful outcome of the war; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, on January 4, 2007, Senator Daniel Inouye introduced S. 57, and on January 31, 2007 Congressman Bob Filner introduced H.R. 760, both known by the &lsquo;Filipino WWII Veterans Equity Act of 2007', that would amend Title 38 of the United States Code to deem certain service in the organized military forces of the government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines and the Philippine Scouts to have been active service for purposes of benefits under programs administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, both bills are reintroductions of bills introduced in every Congress since the 105th Congress that would have granted Filipino veterans of World War II the same rights and benefits as U.S. veterans, but have not been enacted; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Philippine Embassy reports that there are only approximately 18,000 veterans left who would be able to take advantage of the Equity Act, and they are dying at a rate of approximately 8 to 10 a day; and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, many Filipino veterans will not receive the benefits that they deserve and are entitled to if S. 57 and H.R. 760 do not pass; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, it is written in Micah 6:8: &ldquo;And what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the General Conference of The United Methodist Church declares its unqualified support for the &lsquo;Filipino WWII Veterans Equity Act of 2007', that would amend Title 38 of the United States Code to deem Filipino Veterans of WWII to have been in active service of the U.S. military for purposes of benefits under programs administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that the General Conference instructs appropriate agencies, like the General Board of Church and Society, to monitor this legislation in the U.S. Congress, and to enjoin all of its agencies to work with the National Association of Filipino American United Methodists (NAFAUM) and the National Alliance for Filipino Veterans Equity (NAFVE) in ensuring its passage. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED that copies of this resolution be transmitted to the President of the U.S. Senate and the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p></td>
