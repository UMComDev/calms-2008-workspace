<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>299. Understanding Globality in the United Methodist Tradition <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, modern developments in transportation, communications, and technology have brought peoples and nations closer together; and <br> Whereas, globality tends to be understood in The United Methodist Church basically in terms of the United Methodist presence beyond the boundaries of the United States and almost exclusively in relation to those sections of the church that are structurally within it; and <br> Whereas, there are a number of churches in the Methodist family that out of a sense of calling by the Holy Spirit, a desire to affirm their own identity, and their need for self-determination have elected to become autonomous, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church: <br> 1. celebrate the God-given diversity of race, culture, and people at every level of church life in our worship and other activities; <br> 2. celebrate the international dimension of The United Methodist Church consisting of sisters and brothers from different parts of the world including sisters and brothers from indigenous communities; <br> 3. celebrate the autonomous affiliated Methodist churches as important expressions of the diversity of cultures and peoples called by God to be the church universal; <br> 4. work for a future where The United Methodist Church and the autonomous Methodist churches throughout the world, expressing their faith through their unique, God-given culture, will share resources, personnel, and perspectives as equals in their common task of evangelizing all the world; <br> 5. continue and strengthen its ecumenical commitment; and <br> 6. embody this vision as possible in all United Methodist programs. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
