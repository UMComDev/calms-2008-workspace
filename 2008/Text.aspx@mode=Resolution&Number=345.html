<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>345. Emphasize Evangelism <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, we the remaining members who have served for the past two years on the Task Force on Denominational Concerns of the Marietta First UMC; and <br> Whereas, Marietta First UMC, a part of the body of Christ, experienced a split in its congregation resulting in the loss of approximately one-third of its active membership due to real and/or perceived concerns with the denomination; and <br> Whereas, the majority of those leaving were young adults with families who would have constituted much of the future membership of the church; and <br> Whereas, the division in this body of Christ caused conflict and misunderstanding among friends and within families; and <br> Whereas, we who remain, while recognizing much good in our church and in our denomination, have continuing concerns about The United Methodist Church; and <br> Whereas, we love the church and are committed to resolving issues and solving problems and truly desire to ensure the well-being of our denomination and to avoid similar divisions within other United Methodist churches; <br> <i>Therefore,</i> we resolve to offer this constructive recommendation to the 2000 General Conference as the result of our experience and research during these tumultuous times in our church, to reaffirm commitment to and financial support of evangelism in United Methodist programs and institutions with evangelism defined as in<br>Â¶ 627.1 in <i>The 2000 Book of Discipline</i>; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that wherever appropriate in United Methodist programs and institutions, emphasis should be placed on evangelism through commitments to and financial support of such programs. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p>&nbsp; </b>
