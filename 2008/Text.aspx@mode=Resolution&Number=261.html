<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>EDUCATION <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>261. Bilingual Education <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The United States is a country based on the contributions of different races, ethnic groups, languages, and traditions. The fabric of the U.S. society thus is a mosaic of diversity that has enriched its history and its common life as a nation. <br> &nbsp; Education has played a very important role in the development of this nation. To have access to it and to receive a sound education are considered inalienable rights of all children. Bilingual education has been and is a critical tool to ensure these rights for non-English-speaking children living now in this country. It has been an instrument of education for children to make the transition from their native tongues to English (without abandoning their native tongues) while at the same time staying at the level correspondent to their age. Bilingual education does work. There are thousands of living examples of bilingual education successes. They are students who learned English in bilingual classrooms and who continue to achieve to the highest of academic and professional standards. Additionally, the overwhelming majority of scientific research studies clearly show that bilingual education is effective. In fact, not only do children in well-designed bilingual programs acquire academic English as well or better than children in English-only programs (Willig, 1985; Cummins, 1989; Krashen, 1996; Greene, 1997), they do much better in academic content subjects such as math and science.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, we believe that these values are part of the trust of this nation; and <br> Whereas, most educators have confirmed that non-English-speaking children benefit from good bilingual programs; and <br> Whereas, the growth of the non-English-speaking population continues to increase through immigration, and it is estimated to be even larger in the next few decades; and <br> Whereas,percentage of Hispanic Latino/adropouts from school is one of the largest in the country, thus challenging the nation to provide resources for this segment of the population more effectively in both elementary and high schools; and <br> Whereas,of the future envision a larger demand in the fields of mathematics and sciences, precisely where women, Hispanics Latinos/as, African Americans, and Native Americans are currently underrepresented; and <br> Whereas,intentional efforts must be made to bring children and youth from these groups to the same level as the rest of the student population; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the 2004 General Conference proclaim bilingual education to be an educational program needed for this country that must be not only continued but also strengthened; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Conference affirm in writing to the President of the United States, the United States Congress, and the Department of Education that bilingual education is a right for all children and that by strengthening such a program the nation will in reality be laying the foundations for a better future in this land; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> to commend this resolution to all annual conferences for promotion and interpretation, and to ask the General Board of Church and Society to make this resolution an important item in its program and work agenda. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 164<i>D. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
