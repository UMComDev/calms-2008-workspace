<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>276. Repression and the Right to Privacy <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The Social Principles of The United Methodist Church affirm that &ldquo;illegal and unconscionable activities directed against persons or groups by their own governments must not be justified or kept secret, even under the guise of national security&rdquo; (¶ 164<i>C</i>). &ldquo;We strongly reject domestic surveillance and intimidation of political opponents by governments in power and all other misuses of elective or appointive offices&rdquo; (¶ 164<i>A</i>). Citizens of all countries should have access to all essential information regarding their government and its policies.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Openness is a redemptive gift of God, calling for trust and honesty between various segments of the community. Justice is the cornerstone of that trust we have come to expect in our elective and appointive representatives of the community. Communal wholeness is attained through the concerted use of these elements. <br> The prophets of Israel denounced the repression of the poor, widows, orphans, and others of their society, and our Lord&rsquo;s ministry began with the announced purpose to set at liberty the poor and disadvantaged. In our biblical tradition, we raise the following issues: <br> <CENTER><i>Repression <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>We have lived in a time when the accumulated hopes of racial and cultural minorities, combined with a growing dissent in the United States, were met by mounting fears and rising anxieties of the dominant group within the population. Institutions of this society began to reflect these fears and established policies and procedures that, in the short range, provided expedient control. These policies, however, were seen as repressive measures by those who sought legitimate rights and new opportunities. <br> In the immediate past, we sounded a call of concern because we recognized that society can become repressive in nature with hardly a trace of consciousness by the mass of the people, particularly if that people is feverishly fearful and has developed the readiness to accept any measure that seems to offer a new form of protection. <br> It is deplorable that in a society that is democratic in theory and structure there are signs of increasing repression: dragnet arrests; police and the intelligence community&rsquo;s harassment of minority leaders; charges of conspiracy; summary acquittals of police accused of brutality; the rising militancy of rank-and-file police; support for the use of preventive detention; the utilization of wiretaps; censorship of journalism in educational and correctional institutions; heavy punitive action against dissidents; the confinement of those who protested within the military forces; the utilization of grand juries for the purpose of harassment rather than indictment; and the use of church members, clergy, and missionaries for secret intelligence purposes by local police departments, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Central Intelligence Agency. <br> We affirm the many civil, school, and church authorities who are working toward the elimination of these abuses through their work and example; and we note that many of the most flagrant of these acts of repression no longer occur. Congress, the press, and the American people have begun watching agency activities more closely and with a greater demand for public accountability. <br> This vigilance must not be relaxed, for if it is, there may be renewed acts of repression and fresh attempts to curtail the rights of citizens whenever redress is sought for economic and social grievances. <br> Therefore, we urge that all church members and leaders continue to be sensitive to this situation in their local community and in the nation by: <br> 1. seeking to understand and undergird responsible institutions and agencies of the community and being supportive of measurements that will improve them and upgrade their personnel; and <br> 2. establishing programs in the community sponsored by local churches to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; educate church members and their wider community about the potential for repression in the institutions of society;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study and affirm the biblical and constitutional basis for justice under law;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work in state and federal legislatures to bring about just and responsible criminal code revisions that do not reinforce repressive elements in our nation&rsquo;s life;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; oppose forms of legislation that would legalize repression; support legislation that would prohibit intelligence agencies from conducting surveillance or disruption of lawful political activities or otherwise violating constitutional rights;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; develop an awareness of the rights and protection citizens should expect; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; work for institutional change in situations where rights are not respeced and protection is not furnished. <br> <CENTER><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Right to Privacy <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The Christian faith stresses the dignity of and respect for human personality. Invasion of the privacy of an ordinary citizen of society negates this dignity and respect. Further, the Christian faith is supportive of a society that elicits hope and trust, not a society that foments fear and threatens with oppression. <br> &nbsp; The revelation that intelligence agencies, local police, the Internal Revenue Service, and the United States Army have, over a number of years, developed a domestic espionage apparatus involving the gathering of information about the lawful political activities of millions of citizens is a cause for concern. <br> Although it is now illegal for any governmental unit to engage in any kind of wiretapping without a warrant of a court, we urge restraint in the use of wiretapping and electronic surveillance, for its prevalence creates an air of suspicion throughout the whole society and contributes to the insecurity of law-abiding American citizens. <br> <i>Therefore,</i> we respectfully request the Congress of the United States to: <br> 1. enact comprehensive charter legislation for all of the intelligence agencies that would prohibit them from engaging in surveillance or disruption of lawful political activity. We oppose any charter provision that permits intelligence agencies to recruit and use as agents clergy or missionaries; <br> 2. place statutory limitations upon the demand by governmental bureaus and agencies for personal information about any citizen or family for statistical purposes. When such requests by agencies are for information not required by law, the respondent should be informed that compliance is voluntary. Restrictions should be placed by law on private agencies in gathering, storing, and disseminating personal information; and <br> 3. retain the Freedom of Information Act as it is, in support of the right of all citizens to know the actions of their government. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1980<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 164<i>A.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
