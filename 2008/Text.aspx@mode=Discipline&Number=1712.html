Historic sites are designated by formal action of the annual, central, or jurisdictional conference within whose regions the site is located. Such designation shall first be considered and reviewed by the respective commission on archives and history (or equivalent). After action by the annual, central, or jurisdictional conference to designate a building, structure, or location as a historic site, the president or chairperson of the commission on archives and history (or equivalent) shall advise the General Commission on Archives and History of the action taken and provide such documentation as may be required.

Through its Committee on Heritage Landmarks, the commission shall consider the merits of each nomination and shall make such recommendation as it deems appropriate to the ensuing General Conference for its action and determination. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The commission shall recommend only a building, location, or structure for designation as a heritage landmark that has been registered as a historic site by an annual, central, or jurisdictional conference and has met the requirements established by the commission. The commission shall keep a register of all duly designated heritage landmarks and maintain an ongoing file of pertinent information concerning them. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>d)</i> <i>Quadrennial Review</i>-The commission shall be responsible for making a quadrennial review of the existing duly designated heritage landmarks, according to the criteria that it shall prepare and which shall be compatible with <i>The Book of Discipline</i>.<i> </i>The commission shall further be responsible for recommending to the General Conference the redesignation or reclassification of the designated heritage landmarks as such action may be appropriate in keeping with such criteria. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2.<i> Present Heritage Landmarks</i>-The present heritage landmarks of The United Methodist Church (and the year of their designation by General Conference) are: Acuff&rsquo;s Chapel, between Blountville and Kingsport, TN (1968); Albright Memorial Chapel, Kleinfeltersville, PA (1968); Asbury Manual Labor School and Mission, Ft.
