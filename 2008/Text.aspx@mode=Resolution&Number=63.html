<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>CHILDREN <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>63. Childcare and the Church <br> </b><i>Today&rsquo;s Families <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Families today need the church to provide quality, loving care in a safe, stimulating learning environment. More parents of both genders and all socioeconomic classes are entering the labor force, returning to school, and returning to job training programs. More parents are choosing to remain single. Although the number of divorces in the United States shows recent indications of decreasing, the number of children living in a single-parent-headed household continues to increase. With men and women waiting until later in life to become parents, their work patterns are already established and they often continue in those patterns after having children. With increasing awareness of the benefits of early childhood education, parents are seeking programs that enhance their children&rsquo;s physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual growth. The strain of parenting is recognized in cases of child neglect and abuse, as we see through daily reports of the media. There is a need for respite care outside the home to allow parents to resolve issues of neglect and abuse. Parents of a single child or of children with a wide age range recognize the need for their child or children to participate in regular socialization opportunities. Children with special needs, long-term health care needs, and minor illnesses also need childcare while parents must work. <br> <CENTER><i>Our Call <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Our service of infant baptism in The United Methodist Church recognizes the sacredness of each person from birth and our responsibility to nurture each child in the faith. In proclaiming that sacredness and recognizing each child as a child of God, we in the church carry a commitment to help enable people to live life in the fullness that Jesus proclaimed. <br> We promise &ldquo;. . . We will surround these persons with a community of love and forgiveness, that they may grow in their service to others . . .&rdquo; (<i>The United Methodist Hymnal,</i> page 40). In recognition of this promise and in response to the sacredness of all children, our vision for childcare must include a vision of services available to all families on an equitable basis. &ldquo;The Christian faith mandates us to recognize and respond to the value of each human person. Our task as the church is to minister to the needs of all persons and to ensure for them a caring community where all may be nurtured in a dignified and loving manner. This mandate is to be seen not as a burden, but rather as an opportunity.&rdquo; (Adopted 1984. From <i>The Book of Resolutions of The United Methodist Church,</i> 1996. Copyright &#169; 1996 by The United Methodist Publishing House. Used by permission; page 224.) Through the particular ministry of childcare, we extend the nurturing ministry of the church and proclaim justice to children, families, and communities. <br> Childcare is not only a nurturing concern but also a pastoral and prophetic concern for the church. The church has important responsibilities in initiating, encouraging, and participating in the highest quality of childcare for children and families, not only in the local community but also nationwide. <br> Therefore, we recommend the following: <br> 1.<i> See childcare as planned ministry.</i> Each congregation of The United Methodist Church that houses or supports any childcare program must intentionally assess its understanding of discipleship as it relates to this program. Childcare is a valid expression of the Christian faith. However, programs in local churches too often exist without much thought to intentional ministry. Concerns often focus on budgeting and facility use instead of the ministry of the programs. When this happens, misunderstandings arise between the childcare program and the congregation, and missed opportunities occur for witnessing and mirroring the Christian faith. Each childcare program may encompass one or all of the following expressions of ministry. A particular congregation may choose any avenue of ministry, but it is important that each congregation be intentional, involving thought and prayer. What are the congregation&rsquo;s gifts for ministry with children? What is the mission of childcare? How is the intentional ministry a part of the daily operation of the program? <br> Congregations must determine how the childcare program embraces the church&rsquo;s mission. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nurture includes Christian education, stewardship, and worship. In a program that focuses on nurture, spiritual development through Christian education is central. An intentional part of the curriculum should be the selection of stories (biblical and secular) and methods, and the integration of &ldquo;God talk&rdquo; and Christian values into daily conversations and interactions. When celebrations follow the church year, and when themes are based on Christian concepts, our faith traditions are an intentional part of the curriculum. Also included in nurture is stewardship. In our childcare programs, we reflect our commitment to being God&rsquo;s stewards in the ways we use and allocate our physical resources. We also reflect an understanding of the precarious balance of the world in an ecological sense. When children are cared for, they learn to care for others and for their world. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Outreach includes the areas of advocacy, safety, health, welfare, and equity, and how well they are addressed in our communities. Embracing outreach as a part of a weekday ministry program follows our traditional roots of caring for the needs of the community. As a congregation responds to the needs of people in the community through weekday ministry, the community and the congregation discover many blessings. Such a program addresses safety issues, social justice issues, equity issues, and health issues. Specialty childcare that addresses community issues might include care for infants, ill children, children of families at risk, children with special needs, children who are survivors of abuse, children with language barriers, migrant or refugee children, school-age children, and young adolescents. Each congregation should determine the unmet needs of their surrounding community. When possible, congregations should work collaboratively with other community agencies and groups to assure that needs are being met without duplication of efforts and in support of each other. When unable to meet the needs of a community, congregations must be outspoken advocates for needs of children in their community. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness includes the areas of evangelism, membership care, and spiritual formation. In embracing witness as our particular expression of ministry, we proclaim God active in our lives. As Jesus told us to proclaim the good news, so we must through our childcare ministries. Through these ministries, we can minister to the spiritual needs of children and their families. Not to do so is to turn our backs on our call to go into the world proclaiming the message of Jesus Christ. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A witness to our faith speaks clearly through the actions of weekday ministry boards, through the caring love of the staff, through the use of developmentally appropriate practices, through gentle and caring words, through the curriculum, through the environment of the facilities, and through the attitude of the congregation. <br> Every congregation of The United Methodist Church needs to define its ministry through childcare and include a statement of this ministry through weekday programs as part of employee handbooks, parent handbooks, community statements, and church reports. <br> 2.<i> Uphold the quality of childcare in the church.</i> Any time a child enters a childcare program housed in a church, expectations are raised regarding quality of the program, behavior of the childcare staff and church staff, and adherence to the Christian doctrines of love and justice. Whether a congregation sees itself as actually sponsoring the program or as merely a landlord, since the program is in the church, families have different expectations than if they were taking their child to a commercial childcare facility. A church cannot divorce itself, either morally or legally, from what takes place in its building through childcare programs. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Program Reviews: For this reason, annual review of the childcare program should take place. Concern should be given to the curriculum, the involvement of the congregation with the program, pastoral availability to families and staff involved in childcare, safe and clean buildings and equipment, and the highest quality in staff and staff support. The process for the program review must be jointly determined by the childcare staff, church personnel, and informed, interested laity. A plan must be in place. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensing: The purpose of licensing standards is to protect children. Safety, health, space, and staff requirements provide a foundation for establishing and maintaining good programs for children. The regulations of basic health and safety conditions in a building/program that serves children are the appropriate responsibility of the state and do not interfere with the free exercise of religion. United Methodists have been meeting such standards for years in other areas of the life of the church, such as camping. A congregation is responsible to provide the best care for children when they gather in a church building. Regarding licensing procedures, congregations should seek to at least meet, if not surpass, the standards set in their community. Even if a program is license-exempt by the state, an effort should be made to meet licensing requirements for safety and for integrity. Congregations should also seek to be actively informed about such licensing procedures and requirements and should work to reform such regulations when they do not mandate standards that serve the best interests of children. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Self-Study: Through a self-study process, every childcare facility can look for ways to evaluate the care provided. Churches should follow some process of self-study for their childcare programs on a regular basis. Such studies involve both the childcare providers and the congregation and allow them to continuously assess the effectiveness of the ministry they are providing. These self-studies are available through some annual conferences, the Ecumenical Child Care Network, and the National Association of Early Childhood Programs (a division of the National Association for the Education of Young Children). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Personnel: As congregations seek to support childcare programs, salary, benefits, and support of the staff of these programs should be of concern and subject to review and discussion to insure the best for the children and families involved. Congregations must assure that children are served through the best caregivers. Congregations have a responsibility to advocate for higher pay and benefits for childcare workers. These professional caregivers should maintain excellence and integrity in the important job they do, and they should be appropriately compensated for it. <br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With increased concern around issues of child abuse, congregations need to assure that all childcare providers have been adequately screened for child abuse and neglect in accordance with laws of local jurisdiction, especially in the area of sexual misconduct. Appropriate screening protects the children, the childcare providers, and the congregation. The personnel issue also includes a concern for the education and training of childcare workers. A yearly plan for continuing education should be part of the congregation&rsquo;s support for childcare providers. Many childcare providers have extensive training and education in the field. They are good sources for training of those who work with children in other areas of the church, including childcare workers for Sunday services, Sunday school teachers, and vacation Bible school teachers. For those who are hired without proper training and education, the congregations should sponsor and encourage attendance at continuing education events. <br> 3.<i> Be advocates for quality childcare.</i> Going beyond the congregation, United Methodists should be diligent advocates for childcare nationwide. The following suggestions are for individuals and groups within congregations who seek to better the place of children in American society: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become informed about childcare conditions existing today and the issues involved in the design of an adequate public policy for childcare. Address the issues through eliciting a response of commitment from the policy makers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Use the appropriate councils and agencies of the church to monitor public policy at federal, state, and local levels of government. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Become involved not only in church conferences and meetings but in the larger arena of childcare through such organizations as the Children&rsquo;s Defense Fund, the National Association for the Education of Young Children, and the Ecumenical Child Care Network. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call upon staff at the General Board of Church and Society in Washington, DC, and within each annual conference. They are charged with particular responsibility for the church&rsquo;s involvement in public policy processes in order to monitor, serve as an advocate for, raise issues concerning, and bring the voice of the church to bear on childcare policy development. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call upon the staff of the General Board of Discipleship and the United Methodist Publishing House to express arising needs as they relate to program support, needed curriculum, and policies regarding church and childcare center relationships. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Call upon the General Board of Global Ministries to assist churches in responding to childcare needs in their communities with appropriate programs and resources. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call upon the General Board of Discipleship in consultation with the General Council on Finance and Administration to make available to local congregations resources that address legal aspects and procedures to follow in establishing childcare facilities and/or programs. <br> <p align="right"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 162<i>C</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
