When appointments are being made to less than full-time ministry, the district superintendent shall consult with the clergy person to be appointed and the committee on pastor-parish relations regarding proportional time, salary, and pension credit and benefit coverage. <br> 8. If during this consultative process it is determined by the bishop and cabinet that this decision should not be carried out, the process is to be repeated until the bishop, basing his or her decision on the information and advice derived from consultation, makes and fixes the appointment. <br> 9. A similar process of consultation shall be available to persons in appointments beyond the local church. <br> 10. When the steps in the process have been followed and completed, the announcement of that decision shall be made to all parties directly involved in the consultative process, that is, the appointment cabinet, the pastor, and the committee on pastor-parish relations, before a public announcement is made. <br> 22. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 701. <br> 23. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 556. <br> 24. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 556. <br>
