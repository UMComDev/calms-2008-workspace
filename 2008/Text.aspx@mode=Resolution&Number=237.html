<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>237. Rights of Workers <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER></b><i>I. Biblical/Theological Background&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Scripture teaches that human beings, created in the image of God, have an innate dignity (Genesis 1:27). God grants dignity to work by commanding human beings to be stewards of the land and to till and keep the earth (Genesis 1:28, 2:15). Work is one way through which human beings exercise their God-given creativity. Scripture also teaches that an economic system should be ordered so that employees receive justice at their place of work. It mandates that society and its institutions are to be structured so that marginalized persons participate fully in the shaping of society and their own future. This requires respect for the right to organize and bargain collectively without fear of reprisal, to receive a living wage, to be free from discrimination or any form of forced or bonded labor, and the right to a safe and healthy workplace. <br> The concern of The United Methodist Church for the dignity of workers and the rights of employees to act collectively is stated in the Social Principles. Both employer and union are called to &ldquo;bargain in good faith within the frame work of the public interest&rdquo; (¶ 163<i>B</i>). The increasing globalization of the economic system requires the church to reaffirm again our position.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <CENTER><i>II. Characteristics of the International Economy and Working Conditions <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>National economies are being integrated into one global system. This system extends the means of production, financial investments, and employment opportunities around the world to poor and rich countries alike. The ability of workers, governments or other social forces to counter the power of corporations is weakened by the ability of capital to move rapidly from one place to another. <br> Because of capitalist globalization, multinational companies compete with each other on a worldwide scale. This has encouraged third world countries like the Philippines and those in southeast Asia to offer skilled yet cheap labor by practicing contractualization and sub-contractualization. Under this scheme, workers are hired and are asked to sign a contract for three or five months. After the contract has expired, the worker is either asked to leave or sign another contract. Contractual employees, also known as casuals, are not covered by the collective bargaining agreement of the local union because he/she is not a member. Only regular employees become members of the union, and in the Philippines, one has to be an employee for at least 6 months in a company in order to be accepted as a regular worker. Casuals [temporary workers] do not receive bonuses, other cash benefits, social security, minimum wage, and security of employment, among other things. <br> Subcontracting is similar to contractualization. Manufacturing companies work with subcontractors who, in turn, hire contractualized employees. The main company provides the subcontractor with raw materials, and the subcontractor&rsquo;s temporary workers do their job usually in sweatshop conditions without the legal benefits of regular workers. Besides that, they are paid very low wages. It is sad that some United Methodist business people are involved in these unfair labor practices. These practices are allowed by the government and must be stopped. The adoption of this amendment in the resolution for &ldquo;Rights of Workers&rdquo; will help United Methodists in the Philippines to lobby against this scheme with the moral backing of our church. <br> These practices threaten to perpetuate injustice on a global scale: <br> &nbsp; 1. Workers are not paid for how much value they put into the products they produce. They are paid according to the wage scales where they live. This is often not a livable wage. <br> 2. Working conditions, hours, and safety are not regulated by local public authorities, but increasingly by corporations. These corporations can threaten to move if authorities push to change working conditions. <br> 3. Child labor is widely used in many parts of the world. Minorities, migrants, and women still suffer from discrimination in employment. <br> 4. Corporations still reject workers&rsquo; rights of free association, collective bargaining, collective actions. They discriminate against workers who try to organize for these rights. They use the threat of transferring production to defeat organizing efforts and to bargain away rights. <br> 5. Millions of workers are mired in poverty as the global economy becomes more stratified. <br> 6. Big and small industries in developing countries, in an effort to attract investors with cheap labor, practice contractualization and subcontractualization which are schemes to deny workers social security benefits, minimum wage, security of tenure, and membership in a union.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <CENTER><i>III. Witness of The United Methodist Church <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Since The United Methodist Church is a participant in the global economy, we should witness for justice in the international labor arena. The following actions are proposed: <br> 1. The General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries will use a Concern for Workers Task Force in conjunction with annual conference and local church leaders to sponsor religion and labor programs that: (1) study the theological significance of work and employment, (2) initiate cooperation with workers, labor unions, employers, and other organizations about how best to protect and enhance the rights of all workers, especially those of women, children, migrants and people of color and (3) promote Labor Sunday. <br> 2. The church and its agencies, annual conferences, and local congregations will actively support the universally accepted human right of workers to join or support a union or other worker association; call on employers to exercise neutrality toward organizing efforts, recognize the union chosen by the workforce as their bargaining representative and to negotiate a fair agreement with them; and work within the community to prevent employers from taking adverse action against employees who support unions, other worker associations, and other groups trying to bring justice to the workplace. <br> 3. All church agencies, related institutions and organizations, annual conferences, and local congregations should respect their employees&rsquo; rights to good working conditions, fair compensation, and collective action. This includes the right to form a union or other association and participate in its activities without fear of reprisal. Church employers should affirm the Social Principles and support the right of their employees to engage in collective bargaining. <br> 4. The church and its agencies should encourage unions to: (1) accept union responsibility to look beyond their own organizational benefit and be more active in organizing women, temporary employees, people of color, and others disadvantaged in the labor market; (2) promote full participation of rank-and-file members in union decision making; and (3) defend the rights of organized and unorganized workers and develop global solidarity across nations and industries. <br> 5. The church and its agencies should support the conventions of the International Labor Organizations that advance safety in the workplace; freedom from bonded or forced labor; the elimination of discrimination in respect to employment and occupation; effective abolition of child labor; fair compensation; just supervision; and the right of collective action for employees in all nations. The church and its agencies should call for the ratification and enforcement of these conventions. <br> 6. The church and its agencies should join efforts to reform national labor laws that inadequately protect or enable workers to form unions and negotiate terms of employment. These reforms should, at a minimum: (1) enable workers to form unions when a majority have indicated their desires for representation; (2) correct slow administrative or judicial procedures that unduly delay representation decisions; and 3) eliminate exclusions of any class of workers from coverage. <br> 7. The church and its agencies to address the global crisis of unemployment will support development efforts that enhance job creation, effective vocational training, and transitional security measures during periods of economic turmoil. <br> 8. The General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries should urge the United States government to protect the rights of migrant workers through the ratification of the International Convention on the Rights of Migrant Workers and their Families. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1988<br> AMENDED AND ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 163<i>B</i> and <i>C.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
