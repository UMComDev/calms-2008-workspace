<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER>THE NURTURING COMMUNITY <br> </CENTER><CENTER><b>Ecumenical Issues <br> 16.</b><b>&nbsp;Guidelines for Ministering to Mormons <br> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, there is an expressed need on the part of United Methodists for more clarity on the issues surrounding the reception of people baptized in The Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints (Mormons) who seek to become members of The United Methodist Church; and <br> Whereas, there are varying practices in United Methodist churches in such instances, some not recognizing the Latter-day Saints&rsquo; baptism, and so baptizing them; and some recognizing the baptism, and so receiving them as baptized Christians; and <br> Whereas, United Methodists seek to act in ways that are faithful, compassionate, and just in relationship to other faith traditions, extending hospitality toward all and charity toward those whose faith and practice differ from ours; <br> Therefore, while our denomination must continue to seek further clarity on issues of our own faith, we have enough clarity to take steps toward establishing a policy for The United Methodist Church regarding the reception of those converting frm the LDS Church. It is our recommmendation that following a period of catechesis (a time of intensive exploration and instruction in the Christian faith), such a convert should receive the sacrament of Christian baptism. <br> We, further, urge United Methodist churches to utilize <i>Sacramental Faithfulness: Guidelines for Receiving People From The Church of Jesus of Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons),</i>&nbsp;published by the General Board of Discipleship as a study resource and guideline for pastors and congregations who face the challenge of receiving former Mormons who seek to become United Methodists. <br> The board is further authorized to provide resources in accordance with these guidelines for pastors and congregations to help them receive former Latter-day Saints (Mormons) who seek to become United Methodists in ways that are faithful to our United Methodisit heritage. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 161<i>B</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
