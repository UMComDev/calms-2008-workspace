<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>44. Accessibility Grants for Churches <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, it is essential that The United Methodist Church as a denomination find a way to assist individual churches in the annual conferences to find grant money to assist them in becoming more accessible by removing architectural barriers; and <br> Whereas, our denomination establishes many programs around specific groups of people, whether they be ethnic groups or age-targeted groups; and <br> Whereas, each of the groups that the church claims an interest in and sets priorities for includes persons with disabilities. There are more than 54 million in the United States alone. The United Nations recently focused on the issue of disability by calling for institutions to become more accessible; and <br> Whereas, several years ago, $500 grants were awarded to churches that were qualified, to help them increase their accessibility; <br> <i>Therefore be it resolved</i>, that it would be appropriate to set aside monies to again provide accessibility grants or loans to churches in each of the annual conferences. The program could be administered from within the General Board of Global Ministries. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>G.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
