Spiritual Unity in Human Diversity <br /> WHEREAS, The United Methodist Church <strike> is experiencing conflicting</strike>&nbsp; <b>honors and critiques experiences of a variety of</b> expressions of faith and biblical theology; <b>and</b><br /> WHEREAS, The United Methodist Church incorporates confessional traditions (i.e., the Articles of Religion and the Confession of Faith from The Book of Discipline, 1992) and inclusive tradition (&ldquo;The Catholic Spirit&rdquo; sermon by John Wesley); and <br /> WHEREAS, The Book of Discipline, <strike> 1992</strike>&nbsp;(Part II: &ldquo;Doctrinal Standards and Our Theological Task&rdquo;) &ldquo;preserves the inherent tension between doctrinal standards and theological exploration ... [and] involves dialogue, debate, and some conflict&rdquo; (&ldquo;Biblical Wisdom and Current Theological Ferment,&rdquo; Council of Bishops<b>.</b><strike> , 0ctober 31 - November 4, 1994</strike> ); and <br /> WHEREAS, maintaining an inclusive spirit about doctrinal, theological, and language issues serves the greater purpose of helping people to affirm faith in Jesus Christ and to appropriate the historic confessions of the Church; and <br /> WHEREAS, <b>the Revised Common Lectionary Gospel lesson for the Second Sunday of Easter (John 21:19-31) recounts a growth of faith even through doubt, absence, and differing experiences;</b> <strike> confessing faith in scripture truth honors rich diversity in the biblical witness and informs a deeper understanding among people of faith;</strike>&nbsp;and <br /> WHEREAS, &ldquo;indeed, the body does not consist of one member but of many.... [and] God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.... The eye cannot say to the hand, &lsquo;I have no need of you,&rsquo; nor again the head to the feet, &lsquo;I have no need of you.&rsquo; On the contrary, the members of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable, and those members of the body that we think less honorable we clothe with greater honor, and our less respectable members are treated with greater respect; whereas, our more respectable members do not need this. But God has so arranged the body, giving the greater honor to the inferior member, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another&rdquo; (I Corinthians 12:14-25); <br /> THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that The United Methodist Church reject any spirit that seeks to divide the body of Christ (and especially The United Methodist Church)<strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;and that cuts off the confessing and inclusive heritages by which United Methodists know themselves to be people of God</strike> ; and <br /> BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we affirm our biblical faith in Jesus Christ and the spiritual gift of unity in human diversity; <b>and</b><br /> <b>BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Second Sunday of Easter be designated &ldquo;Our Theological Task Sunday&rdquo; to highlight Â¶104. SECTION 4 - OUR THEOLOGICAL TASK of our Book of Discipline.</b><br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This resolution seeks to sharpen the focus of the #79: Spiritual Unity In Human Diversity by providing for a Theological Task Sunday, encouraging dialogue and conversations about &ldquo;our biblical faith in Jesus Christ,&rdquo; seeking &ldquo;unity in human diversity.&rdquo;<br /> <br /></p></td>
