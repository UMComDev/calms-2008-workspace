During the suspension, salary, housing and benefits will continue. <br /> b)&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisory response is pastoral and administrative and shall be directed toward a just resolution. It is not a part of any judicial process. The supervisory response should be carried out in a confidential manner and should be completed within 120 days. There may be 2 additional extensions of 120 days if the <strike> supervising Bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central conference episcopacy committee</b> determines that an extension will be productive. The <strike> supervising Bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central Conference Episcopacy</b> shall regularly advise all parties of the status of the process and shall notify all parties within 7 days after a determination is made that the supervisory response will not lead to a resolution of the matter. <br /> No verbatim record shall be made and legal counsel shall not be present, although the bishop against whom the complaint was made and the Complainant both may choose another person to accompany him or her, with the right to voice. At the determination of the <strike> president (secretary)</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central conference episcopacy committee</b>, persons with qualifications and experience in assessment, intervention, or healing may be selected to assist in the supervisory responses. Others may be consulted as well. <br /> c)&nbsp;&nbsp;The supervisory response may include a process seeking a just resolution in which the parties are assisted by a trained, impartial third party facilitator(s) or mediator(s) in reaching an agreement satisfactory to all parties. (See ¶ 362.1[b]). The <strike> appropriate persons, including the president of the College of Bishops, or secretary if the complaint concerns the president</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central conference episcopacy committee</b> should enter into a written agreement outlining such process, including an agreement as to confidentiality. If resolution is achieved, a written statement of resolution, including terms and conditions, shall be signed by the parties and the parties shall agree on any matters to be disclosed to third parties. Such written statement of resolution shall be given to the person in charge of that stage of the process for further action consistent with the agreement. <br /> d)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the supervisory response results in the resolution of the matter, the <strike> bishop</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson</b> in charge of the supervisory response shall monitor the fulfillment of the terms of the resolution. If the supervisory response does not result in resolution of the matter, <strike> the president or secretary of the College of Bishops</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central conference episcopacy committee </b>may refer the matter as an Administrative Complaint (¶ 413.3[e]) or a Judicial Complaint (¶ 2704.1). <br /> e)&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Administrative </i>Complaint &ndash; If the complaint is based on allegations of incompetence, ineffectiveness, or unwillingness or inability to perform episcopal duties, the <strike> president and secretary (or the two members of the college who are handling the complaint)</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the jurisdictional or central conference episcopacy committee</b> may refer the complaint to the jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy. The committee may recommend involuntary retirement (¶ 409.3), disability leave (¶ 411.4), remedial measures (¶ 362.4a), other appropriate action, or it may dismiss the complaint.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy deems the matter serious enough and when one or more offenses listed in ¶ 2702 are involved, the committee may refer the complaint back to the <strike> president and secretary (or the two members of the college who are handling the complaint)</strike>&nbsp; <b>chairperson of the Jurisdictional or Central Conference Episcopacy</b> for referral as a judicial complaint to the jurisdictional or central conference committee on investigation. The provisions of ¶362.3 for fair process in administrative hearings shall apply to this administrative process. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This petition changes the accountability for complaints against bishops from the College of Bishops to the Jurisdictional or Central Conference Episcopacy Committee.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is in keeping with the ruling of the Judicial Council (Decision 475). <br /> <br /></p></td>
