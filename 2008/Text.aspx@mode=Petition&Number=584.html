We are called to "proclaim release to&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> the captives . . . to set at liberty those who are oppressed" (Luke 4:18, RSV).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Economic realities, such as "one world economies" and "mega-mergers," can have a negative impact on both the rich and poor of this world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Native American spirituality speaks to and challenges inequities with its understanding of how to care for the whole family of God. Native American United Methodists believe their cultural understanding of stewardship is God-given and has been distorted from its intended purpose; God's creation has been used with greed rather than care.&nbsp;&nbsp;Native Americans in The United Methodist Church believe that the Church must take a proactive stand for reform of church and society that will introduce a radically different model of economic relationships into the new century--a God-centered model. The United Methodist Church believes that models of economic development should not have a negative impact on Native American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>For more than five hundred years, Native Americans have lived and survived in the context of first, colonialism and second, capitalism and have been impacted by the economics of greed. Many have been forced to live in poverty; however, a small segment of the Native American population is surviving through tribal economic </b><br /> <b>development based on gambling.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, tribal gambling casinos have had negative social consequences beyond and even within tribes. </b><br /> The need for economic development and growth is critically acute in most Native American communities across the United States. Economic conditions are appalling, with some reservations fac<b>ing exceptionally high rates (some as high as 80-90 percent) of</b><strike> ing upwards of 80 percent</strike>&nbsp;unemployment <strike> and poverty rates<b></strike> well above</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;at many times </strike> the national average.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>In fact, many </b><strike> Native American </strike> reservations<b> have very</b><strike> have the</strike>&nbsp;high<strike> est</strike>&nbsp;poverty rate<b>s in the United States and</b><strike> America.<b></strike>&nbsp;rank very low in </b><strike> H<b></strike> h</b>ealth<b> and</b><strike> ,</strike>&nbsp;education<b> indicators</b><strike> , and income <b></strike> .</b><strike> statistics are the worst in the country. <b></strike> T</b><strike> T</strike> here is <strike> virtually <b></strike> little or </b>no tax base on many reservations. Equity for investment is practically nonexistent<b> or equity comes from questionable sources and at an exorbitant rate. As a result</b><strike> , and capital for development is nearly impossible to obtain. S<b></strike>&nbsp;s</b>ome tribes have resorted to gambling<b> endeavors </b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;enterprises </strike> in an effort to <strike> transform <b></strike> improve </b>their economies. <b>However, t</b><strike> T</strike> he vast majority of tribes remain in desperate need of meaningful, diversified economic development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Economic development encompasses everything from job creation to reform in tax codes, from the creation of banking institutions to the expansion of tribal <b>autonomy</b><strike> authority</strike> ; <strike> . D<b></strike> d</b>evelopment of basic physical infrastructure <strike> such as <b></strike> (</b>roads<b> and</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;and</strike>&nbsp;sewers<b>);</b><strike> , </strike> telecommunications to bridge the digital divide<b>;</b><strike> , and </strike> fiscal literacy development for&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Native American people<b>. Collectively, these basic essentials are </b><strike> must<b></strike>&nbsp;requirements</b><strike> all </strike> <br /> <strike> occur</strike>&nbsp;for <strike> successful <b></strike> effective </b>economic development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Tribal sovereignty is historical, legal, and sacred to American Indian people.</b><strike> With due recognition of tribal sovereignty and the self-determining aspirations of Native Americans,<b></strike>&nbsp;W</b><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;w</strike> e affirm <b>autonomous decision-making </b><strike> economic development as a critical means </strike> by <strike> which </strike> Native America<b>n tribes. After all, t</b><strike> n communities will truly be empowered to pursue their own priorities for their people and their lands and the only means to successfully weave tribal economies into the larger economic fabric of the Americas. T</strike> he <b>primary</b><strike> ultimate</strike>&nbsp;goal of economic development is to create <strike> economic </strike> self-sufficiency in Native American <b>tribes</b><strike> communities</strike> . <b>Ultimately, sovereignty ensures and enables tribes to deliberate and map out a strategy that will hopefully lead to self-sufficiency.</b><strike> The primary economic decisions must be made by tribes. Tribes must control their own affairs and </strike> <br /> The U.S. Department of the Interior has grossly mismanaged tribal lands and has lost track of billions of dollars in mining, logging, and other royalties that should have gone to benefit Native American tribes. <b>Fiscal accountability and </b><strike> Cleaning up the accounting and <b></strike> ethical </b>management of trust funds is <b>an absolute necessity in the quest for tribal economic self-sufficiency</b><strike> critical</strike> .&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <b>Therefore, be it resolved that The United Methodist Church: </b><br /> <strike> The General Conference of The United Methodist Church urges: </strike> <br /> 1. <strike> United Methodists to s<b></strike>&nbsp;S</b><strike> upport <b></strike> supports the </b><strike> the </strike> efforts of sovereign Native American nations to create means and methods of economic development that do not depend on gambling and do not disrupt or destroy sacred sites<b>.</b><strike> ; </strike> <br /> 2. <b>Urges</b><strike> the<b></strike>&nbsp;the</b> U.S. government <b>to affirm tribal sovereignty</b><strike> to end its domination and paternalism</strike>&nbsp;and work with Native American tribes in a genuine partnership to support economic development and trust reform<b>.</b><strike> ; </strike> <br /> 3. Directs the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Discipleship in collaboration with Native Americans to develop educational tools for local churches and individuals as a study on contemporary Native American issues; especially tribal sovereignty as it relates to effective economic development.&nbsp;&nbsp;The studies should also include the Church&rsquo;s role in influencing contemporary mission and ministry with Native people and create strategies and actions which can allow active participation of local churches in assisting Native Americans to find a God-centered alternative to gambling as a form of economic development.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike> . the General Board of Church and Society and the Native American Comprehensive Plan of the General Board of Global Ministries to cosponsor the Native American Economic Development and Empowerment Task Force. The responsibilities of the task force are to provide ways for United Methodist boards, agencies, and annual conferences to work with Native American tribes on economic development; to develop collaborative models for economic empowerment; to consider convening a summit with socially responsible investors, community development organizations, religious representatives, and government officials on Native American economic development; and to monitor public programs and holding decision-makers accountable; </strike> <br /> <b>4.
