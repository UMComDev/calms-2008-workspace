<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><b>¶&nbsp;103. SECTION 3-OUR DOCTRINAL STANDARDS<br> AND GENERAL RULES <br> </b>THE ARTICLES OF RELIGION OF THE METHODIST CHURCH</sub><sup>3</sup></sub><br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;[Bibliographical Note: The Articles of Religion are here reprinted from the <i>Discipline</i> of 1808 (when the first Restrictive Rule took effect), collated against Wesley&rsquo;s original text in <i>The Sunday Service of the Methodists</i> (1784). To these are added two Articles: &ldquo;Of Sanctification&rdquo; and &ldquo;Of the Duty of Christians to the Civil Authority,&rdquo; which are legislative enactments and not integral parts of the document as protected by the Constitution (<i>see</i> Judicial Council Decisions 41, 176).] <br> <b>Article I-Of Faith in the Holy Trinity <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>There is but one living and true God, everlasting, without body or parts, of infinite power, wisdom, and goodness; the maker and preserver of all things, both visible and invisible. And in unity of this Godhead there are three persons, of one substance, power, and eternity-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. <br> <b>Article II-Of the Word, or Son of God, Who Was Made Very Man <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Son, who is the Word of the Father, the very and eternal God, of one substance with the Father, took man&rsquo;s nature in the womb of the the blessed Virgin; so that two whole and perfect natures, that is to say, the Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one person, never to be divided; whereof is one Christ, very God and very Man, who truly suffered, was crucified, dead, and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for actual sins of men. <br> <b>Article III-Of the Resurrection of Christ <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Christ did truly rise again from the dead, and took again his body, with all things appertaining to the perfection of man&rsquo;s nature, wherewith he ascended into heaven, and there sitteth until he return to judge all men at the last day. <br> <b>Article IV-Of the Holy Ghost <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory with the Father and the Son, very and eternal God. <br> <b>Article V-Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for Salvation <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to salvation; so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man that it should be believed as an article of faith, or be thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical books of the Old and New Testament of whose authority was never any doubt in the church. The names of the canonical books are: <br> Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, The First Book of Samuel, The Second Book of Samuel, The First Book of Kings, The Second Book of Kings, The First Book of Chronicles, The Second Book of Chronicles, The Book of Ezra, The Book of Nehemiah, The Book of Esther, The Book of Job, The Psalms, The Proverbs, Ecclesiastes or the Preacher, Cantica or Songs of Solomon, Four Prophets the Greater, Twelve Prophets the Less. <br> All the books of the New Testament, as they are commonly received, we do receive and account canonical. <br> <b>Article VI-Of the Old Testament <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Old Testament is not contrary to the New; for both in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator between God and man, being both God and Man. Wherefore they are not to be heard who feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises. Although the law given from God by Moses as touching ceremonies and rites doth not bind Christians, nor ought the civil precepts thereof of necessity be received in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no Christian whatsoever is free from the obedience of the commandments which are called moral. <br> <b>Article VII-Of Original or Birth Sin <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vainly talk), but it is the corruption of the nature of every man, that naturally is engendered of the offspring of Adam, whereby man is very far gone from original righteousness, and of his own nature inclined to evil, and that continually. <br> <b>Article VIII-Of Free Will <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The condition of man after the fall of Adam is such that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own natural strength and works, to faith, and calling upon God; wherefore we have no power to do good works, pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will, and working with us, when we have that good will. <br> <b>Article IX-Of the Justification of Man <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We are accounted righteous before God only for the merit of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, by faith, and not for our own works or deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by faith, only, is a most wholesome doctrine, and very full of comfort. <br> <b>Article X-Of Good Works <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Although good works, which are the fruits of faith, and follow after justification, cannot put away our sins, and endure the severity of God&rsquo;s judgment; yet are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, and spring out of a true and lively faith, insomuch that by them a lively faith may be as evidently known as a tree is discerned by its fruit. <br> <b>Article XI-Of Works of Supererogation <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Voluntary works-besides, over and above God&rsquo;s commandments-which they call works of supererogation, cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety. For by them men do declare that they do not only render unto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake than of bounden duty is required; whereas Christ saith plainly: When you have done all that is commanded you, say, We are unprofitable servants. <br> <b>Article XII-Of Sin After Justification <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Not every sin willingly committed after justification is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable. Wherefore, the grant of repentance is not to be denied to such as fall into sin after justification. After we have received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace given, and fall into sin, and, by the grace of God, rise again and amend our lives. And therefore they are to be condemned who say they can no more sin as long as they live here; or deny the place of forgiveness to such as truly repent. <br> <b>Article XIII-Of the Church <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The visible church of Christ is a congregation of faithful men in which the pure Word of God is preached, and the Sacraments duly administered according to Christ&rsquo;s ordinance, in all those things that of necessity are requisite to the same. <br> <b>Article XIV-Of Purgatory</sub><sup>4 <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></sub></b>The Romish doctrine concerning purgatory, pardon, worshiping, and adoration, as well of images as of relics, and also invocation of saints, is a fond thing, vainly invented, and grounded upon no warrant of Scripture, but repugnant to the Word of God. <br> </sup></sub><b>Article XV-Of Speaking in the Congregation in Such a Tongue as the People Understand <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God, and the custom of the primitive church, to have public prayer in the church, or to minister the Sacraments, in a tongue not understood by the people. <br> <b>Article XVI-Of the Sacraments <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Sacraments ordained of Christ are not only badges or tokens of Christian men&rsquo;s profession, but rather they are certain signs of grace, and God&rsquo;s good will toward us, by which he doth work invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also strengthen and confirm, our faith in him. <br> There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord in the Gospel; that is to say, Baptism and the Supper of the Lord. <br> Those five commonly called sacraments, that is to say, confirmation, penance, orders, matrimony, and extreme unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments of the Gospel; being such as have partly grown out of the <i>corrupt</i> following of the apostles, and partly are states of life allowed in the Scriptures, but yet have not the like nature of Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, because they have not any visible sign or ceremony ordained of God. <br> The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be gazed upon, or to be carried about; but that we should duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation; but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to themselves condemnation, as St. Paul saith. <br> <b>Article XVII-Of Baptism <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Baptism is not only a sign of profession and mark of difference whereby Christians are distinguished from others that are not baptized; but it is also a sign of regeneration or the new birth. The Baptism of young children is to be retained in the Church.</sub><sup>5 <br> </sup></sub><b>Article XVIII-Of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper <br> </sup></sub></b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love that Christians ought to have among themselves one to another, but rather is a sacrament of our redemption by Christ&rsquo;s death; insomuch that, to such as rightly, worthily, and with faith receive the same, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Christ; and likewise the cup of blessing is a partaking of the blood of Christ. <br> Transubstantiation, or the change of the substance of bread and wine in the Supper of our Lord, cannot be proved by Holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a sacrament, and hath given occasion to many superstitions. <br> The body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten in the Supper, only after a heavenly and spiritual manner. And the mean whereby the body of Christ is received and eaten in the Supper is faith. <br> The Sacrament of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper was not by Christ&rsquo;s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshiped. <br> <b>Article XIX-Of Both Kinds <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the lay people; for both the parts of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, by Christ&rsquo;s ordinance and commandment, ought to be administered to all Christians alike. <br> <b>Article XX-Of the One Oblation of Christ,<br> Finished upon the Cross <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The offering of Christ, once made, is that perfect redemption, propitiation, and satisfaction for all the sins of the whole world, both original and actual; and there is none other satisfaction for sin but that alone. Wherefore the sacrifice of masses, in the which it is commonly said that the priest doth offer Christ for the quick and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, is a blasphemous fable and dangerous deceit. <br> <b>Article XXI-Of the Marriage of Ministers <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The ministers of Christ are not commanded by God&rsquo;s law either to vow the estate of single life, or to abstain from marriage; therefore it is lawful for them, as for all other Christians, to marry at their own discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve best to godliness. <br> <b>Article XXII-Of the Rites and Ceremonies of Churches <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>It is not necessary that rites and ceremonies should in all places be the same, or exactly alike; for they have been always different, and may be changed according to the diversity of countries, times, and men&rsquo;s manners, so that nothing be ordained against God&rsquo;s Word. Whosoever, through his private judgment, willingly and purposely doth openly break the rites and ceremonies of the church to which he belongs, which are not repugnant to the Word of God, and are ordained and approved by common authority, ought to be rebuked openly, that others may fear to do the like, as one that offendeth against the common order of the church, and woundeth the consciences of weak brethren. <br> Every particular church may ordain, change, or abolish rites and ceremonies, so that all things may be done to edification. <br> <b>Article XXIII-Of the Rulers of the United States of America <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The President, the Congress, the general assemblies, the governors, and the councils of state, <i>as the delegates of the people,</i> are the rulers of the United States of America, according to the division of power made to them by the Constitution of the United States and by the constitutions of their respective states. And the said states are a sovereign and independent nation, and ought not to be subject to any foreign jurisdiction. <br> <b>Article XXIV-Of Christian Men&rsquo;s Goods <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>The riches and goods of Christians are not common as touching the right, title, and possession of the same, as some do falsely boast. Notwithstanding, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth, liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability. <br> <b>Article XXV-Of a Christian Man&rsquo;s Oath <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>As we confess that vain and rash swearing is forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ and James his apostle, so we judge that the Christian religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may swear when the magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the prophet&rsquo;s teaching, in justice, judgment, and truth. <br> [The following Article from the Methodist Protestant Discipline is placed here by the Uniting Conference (1939). It was not one of the Articles of Religion voted upon by the three churches.] <br> <b>Of Sanctification <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Sanctification is that renewal of our fallen nature by the Holy Ghost, received through faith in Jesus Christ, whose blood of atonement cleanseth from all sin; whereby we are not only delivered from the guilt of sin, but are washed from its pollution, saved from its power, and are enabled, through grace, to love God with all our hearts and to walk in his holy commandments blameless. <br> [The following provision was adopted by the Uniting Conference (1939). This statement seeks to interpret to our churches in foreign lands Article XXIII of the Articles of Religion. It is a legislative enactment but is not a part of the Constitution. (See Judicial Council Decisions 41, 176, and Decision 6, Interim Judicial Council.)] <br> <b>Of the Duty of Christians to the Civil Authority <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>It is the duty of all Christians, and especially of all Christian ministers, to observe and obey the laws and commands of the governing or supreme authority of the country of which they are citizens or subjects or in which they reside, and to use all laudable means to encourage and enjoin obedience to the powers that be. <br> <b>THE CONFESSION OF FAITH<br> OF THE EVANGELICAL UNITED BRETHREN CHURCH</sub><sup></b>6 <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></sub>[Bibliographical Note: The text of the Confession of Faith is identical to that of its original in <i>The Discipline of The Evangelical United Brethren Church</i> (1963).] <br> </sup></sub><b>Article I-God <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe in the one true, holy and living God, Eternal Spirit, who is Creator, Sovereign and Preserver of all things visible and invisible. He is infinite in power, wisdom, justice, goodness and love, and rules with gracious regard for the well-being and salvation of men, to the glory of his name. We believe the one God reveals himself&nbsp;&nbsp;as the Trinity: Father, Son and Holy Spirit, distinct but inseparable, eternally one in essence and power. <br> <b>Article II-Jesus Christ <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe in Jesus Christ, truly God and truly man, in whom the divine and human natures are perfectly and inseparably united. He is the eternal Word made flesh, the only begotten Son of the Father, born of the Virgin Mary by the power of the Holy Spirit. As ministering Servant he lived, suffered and died on the cross. He was buried, rose from the dead and ascended into heaven to be with the Father, from whence he shall return. He is eternal Savior and Mediator, who intercedes for us, and by him all men will be judged. <br> <b>Article III-The Holy Spirit <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe in the Holy Spirit who proceeds from and is one in being with the Father and the Son. He convinces the world of sin, of righteousness and of judgment. He leads men through faithful response to the gospel into the fellowship of the Church. He comforts, sustains and empowers the faithful and guides them into all truth. <br> <b>Article IV-The Holy Bible <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe the Holy Bible, Old and New Testaments, reveals the Word of God so far as it is necessary for our salvation. It is to be received through the Holy Spirit as the true rule and guide for faith and practice. Whatever is not revealed in or established by the Holy Scriptures is not to be made an article of faith nor is it to be taught as essential to salvation. <br> <b>Article V-The Church <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe the Christian Church is the community of all true believers under the Lordship of Christ. We believe it is one, holy, apostolic and catholic. It is the redemptive fellowship in which the Word of God is preached by men divinely called, and the sacraments are duly administered according to Christ&rsquo;s own appointment. Under the discipline of the Holy Spirit the Church exists for the maintenance of worship, the edification of believers and the redemption of the world. <br> <b>Article VI-The Sacraments <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe the Sacraments, ordained by Christ, are symbols and pledges of the Christian&rsquo;s profession and of God&rsquo;s love toward us. They are means of grace by which God works invisibly in us, quickening, strengthening and confirming our faith in him. Two Sacraments are ordained by Christ our Lord, namely Baptism and the Lord&rsquo;s Supper. <br> We believe Baptism signifies entrance into the household of faith, and is a symbol of repentance and inner cleansing from sin, a representation of the new birth in Christ Jesus and a mark of Christian discipleship. <br> We believe children are under the atonement of Christ and as heirs of the Kingdom of God are acceptable subjects for Christian Baptism. Children of believing parents through Baptism become the special responsibility of the Church. They should be nurtured and led to personal acceptance of Christ, and by profession of faith confirm their Baptism. <br> We believe the Lord&rsquo;s Supper is a representation of our redemption, a memorial of the sufferings and death of Christ, and a token of love and union which Christians have with Christ and with one another. Those who rightly, worthily and in faith eat the broken bread and drink the blessed cup partake of the body and blood of Christ in a spiritual manner until he comes. <br> <b>Article VII-Sin and Free Will <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe man is fallen from righteousness and, apart from the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, is destitute of holiness and inclined to evil. Except a man be born again, he cannot see the Kingdom of God. In his own strength, without divine grace, man cannot do good works pleasing and acceptable to God. We believe, however, man influenced and empowered by the Holy Spirit is responsible in freedom to exercise his will for good. <br> <b>Article VIII-Reconciliation Through Christ <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself. The offering Christ freely made on the cross is the perfect and sufficient sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, redeeming man from all sin, so that no other satisfaction is required. <br> <b>Article IX-Justification and Regeneration <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe we are never accounted righteous before God through our works or merit, but that penitent sinners are justified or accounted righteous before God only by faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. <br> We believe regeneration is the renewal of man in righteousness through Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit, whereby we are made partakers of the divine nature and experience newness of life. By this new birth the believer becomes reconciled to God and is enabled to serve him with the will and the affections. <br> We believe, although we have experienced regeneration, it is possible to depart from grace and fall into sin; and we may even then, by the grace of God, be renewed in righteousness. <br> <b>Article X-Good Works <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe good works are the necessary fruits of faith and follow regeneration but they do not have the virtue to remove our sins or to avert divine judgment. We believe good works, pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, spring from a true and living faith, for through and by them faith is made evident. <br> <b>Article XI-Sanctification and Christian Perfection <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe sanctification is the work of God&rsquo;s grace through the Word and the Spirit, by which those who have been born again are cleansed from sin in their thoughts, words and acts, and are enabled to live in accordance with God&rsquo;s will, and to strive for holiness without which no one will see the Lord. <br> Entire sanctification is a state of perfect love, righteousness and true holiness which every regenerate believer may obtain by being delivered from the power of sin, by loving God with all the heart, soul, mind and strength, and by loving one&rsquo;s neighbor as one&rsquo;s self. Through faith in Jesus Christ this gracious gift may be received in this life both gradually and instantaneously, and should be sought earnestly by every child of God. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;We believe this experience does not deliver us from the infirmities, ignorance, and mistakes common to man, nor from the possibilities of further sin. The Christian must continue on guard against spiritual pride and seek to gain victory over every temptation to sin. He must respond wholly to the will of God so that sin will lose its power over him; and the world, the flesh, and the devil are put under his feet. Thus he rules over these enemies with watchfulness through the power of the Holy Spirit. <br> <b>Article XII-The Judgment and the Future State <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe all men stand under the righteous judgment of Jesus Christ, both now and in the last day. We believe in the resurrection of the dead; the righteous to life eternal and the wicked to endless condemnation. <br> <b>Article XIII-Public Worship <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe divine worship is the duty and privilege of man who, in the presence of God, bows in adoration, humility and dedication. We believe divine worship is essential to the life of the Church, and that the assembling of the people of God for such worship is necessary to Christian fellowship and spiritual growth. <br> We believe the order of public worship need not be the same in all places but may be modified by the church according to circumstances and the needs of men. It should be in a language and form understood by the people, consistent with the Holy Scriptures to the edification of all, and in accordance with the order and <i>Discipline</i> of the Church. <br> <b>Article XIV-The Lord&rsquo;s Day <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe the Lord&rsquo;s Day is divinely ordained for private and public worship, for rest from unnecessary work, and should be devoted to spiritual improvement, Christian fellowship and service. It is commemorative of our Lord&rsquo;s resurrection and is an emblem of our eternal rest. It is essential to the permanence and growth of the Christian Church, and important to the welfare of the civil community. <br> <b>Article XV-The Christian and Property <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe God is the owner of all things and that the individual holding of property is lawful and is a sacred trust under God. Private property is to be used for the manifestation of Christian love and liberality, and to support the Church&rsquo;s mission in the world. All forms of property, whether private, corporate or public, are to be held in solemn trust and used responsibly for human good under the sovereignty of God. <br> <b>Article XVI-Civil Government <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>We believe civil government derives its just powers from the sovereign God. As Christians we recognize the governments under whose protection we reside and believe such governments should be based on, and be responsible for, the recognition of human rights under God. We believe war and bloodshed are contrary to the gospel and spirit of Christ. We believe it is the duty of Christian citizens to give moral strength and purpose to their respective governments through sober, righteous and godly living. <br> THE STANDARD SERMONS OF WESLEY <br>[Bibliographical Note: The Wesleyan &ldquo;standards&rdquo; have been reprinted frequently. The critical edition of Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Sermons</i> is included in <i>The Works of John Wesley,</i> vols. 1-4 (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1984-87).] <br> THE EXPLANATORY NOTES UPON THE NEW TESTAMENT <br>[Bibliographical Note: <i>The Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament</i> (1755) is currently in print (Schmul Publishing Company&rsquo;s 1975 edition) and is forthcoming as vols. 5-6 of <i>The Works of John Wesley</i>.] <br> <b>THE GENERAL RULES OF THE METHODIST CHURCH</sub><sup></b>7 <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</sup></sub>[Bibliographical Note: The General Rules are printed here in the text of 1808 (when the fifth Restrictive Rule took effect), as subsequently amended by constitutional actions in 1848 and 1868.] <br> </sup></sub><b>The Nature, Design, and General Rules of Our United Societies <br> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>In the latter end of the year 1739 eight or ten persons came to Mr. Wesley, in London, who appeared to be deeply convinced of sin, and earnestly groaning for redemption. They desired, as did two or three more the next day, that he would spend some time with them in prayer, and advise them how to flee from the wrath to come, which they saw continually hanging over their heads. That he might have more time for this great work, he appointed a day when they might all come together, which from thenceforward they did every week, namely, on Thursday in the evening. To these, and as many more as desired to join with them (for their number increased daily), he gave those advices from time to time which he judged most needful for them, and they always concluded their meeting with prayer suited to their several necessities. <br> This was the rise of the <b>United Society,</b> first in Europe, and then in America. Such a society is no other than &ldquo;a company of men having the <i>form</i> and seeking the <i>power</i> of godliness, united in order to pray together, to receive the word of exhortation, and to watch over one another in love, that they may help each other to work out their salvation.&rdquo;<br> That it may the more easily be discerned whether they are indeed working out their own salvation, each society is divided into smaller companies, called <b>classes</b>, according to their respective places of abode. There are about twelve persons in a class, one of whom is styled the <b>leader. </b>It is his duty: <br> 1. To see each person in his class once a week at least, in order:<br> (1) to inquire how their souls prosper; (2) to advise, reprove, comfort or exhort, as occasion may require; (3) to receive what they are willing to give toward the relief of the preachers, church, and poor. <br> 2. To meet the ministers and the stewards of the society once a week, in order: (1) to inform the minister of any that are sick, or of any that walk disorderly and will not be reproved; (2) to pay the stewards what they have received of their several classes in the week preceding. <br> There is only one condition previously required of those who desire admission into these societies: &ldquo;a desire to flee from the wrath to come, and to be saved from their sins.&rdquo; But wherever this is really fixed in the soul it will be shown by its fruits. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;It is therefore expected of all who continue therein that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>First</i>: By doing no harm, by avoiding evil of every kind, especially that which is most generally practiced, such as: <br> The taking of the name of God in vain. <br> The profaning the day of the Lord, either by doing ordinary work therein or by buying or selling. <br> Drunkenness: buying or selling spirituous liquors, or drinking them, unless in cases of extreme necessity. <br> Slaveholding; buying or selling slaves. <br> Fighting, quarreling, brawling, brother going to law with brother; returning evil for evil, or railing for railing; the using many words in buying or selling. <br> The buying or selling goods that have not paid the duty. <br> The giving or taking things on usury-i.e., unlawful interest. <br> Uncharitable or unprofitable conversation; particularly speaking evil of magistrates or of ministers. <br> Doing to others as we would not they should do unto us. <br> Doing what we know is not for the glory of God, as: <br> The putting on of gold and costly apparel. <br> The taking such diversions as cannot be used in the name of the Lord Jesus. <br> The singing those songs, or reading those books, which do not tend to the knowledge or love of God. <br> Softness and needless self-indulgence. <br> Laying up treasure upon earth. <br> Borrowing without a probability of paying; or taking up goods without a probability of paying for them. <br> It is expected of all who continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, <br> <i>Secondly</i>: By doing good; by being in every kind merciful after their power; as they have opportunity, doing good of every possible sort, and, as far as possible, to all men: <br> To their bodies, of the ability which God giveth, by giving food to the hungry, by clothing the naked, by visiting or helping them that are sick or in prison. <br> To their souls, by instructing, reproving, or exhorting all we have any intercourse with; trampling under foot that enthusiastic doctrine that &ldquo;we are not to do good unless <i>our hearts be free to it.&rdquo;<br> </i>By doing good, especially to them that are of the household of faith or groaning so to be; employing them preferably to others; buying one of another, helping each other in business, and so much the more because the world will love its own and them only. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;By all possible diligence and frugality, that the gospel be not blamed. <br> By running with patience the race which is set before them, denying themselves, and taking up their cross daily; submitting to bear the reproach of Christ, to be as the filth and offscouring of the world; and looking that men should say all manner of evil of them <i>falsely, </i>for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. <br> It is expected of all who desire to continue in these societies that they should continue to evidence their desire of salvation, <br> <i>Thirdly</i>: By attending upon all the ordinances of God; such are: <br> The public worship of God. <br> The ministry of the Word, either read or expounded. <br> The Supper of the Lord. <br> Family and private prayer. <br> Searching the Scriptures. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;Fasting or abstinence. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;These are the General Rules of our societies; all of which we are taught of God to observe, even in his written Word, which is the only rule, and the sufficient rule, both of our faith and practice. And all these we know his Spirit writes on truly awakened hearts. If there be any among us who observe them not, who habitually break any of them, let it be known unto them who watch over that soul as they who must give an account. We will admonish him of the error of his ways. We will bear with him for a season. But then, if he repent not, he hath no more place among us. We have delivered our own souls. <br> 3.
