He believed that a satisfying spiritual experience could not survive apart from enthusiasm for service to mankind.&rdquo; Parkinson, History of the Board of Hospitals and Homes. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant, and whoever wants to be first must be your slave...just as the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve.&rdquo; Matthew 20: 26-28. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;The servant-leader is servant first. It begins with the natural feeling that one wants to serve. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to lead. The best test is: do those served grow as persons? Do they, while being served, become healthier, wiser, freer, more autonomous, more likely themselves to become servants?&nbsp;&nbsp;And, what is the effect on the least privileged in society? Will they benefit or, at least, not be further deprived?&rdquo; Greenleaf, The Servant Leader. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, Christ demonstrated a concern for healing of body, mind and soul throughout His ministry; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, John Wesley repeatedly demonstrated his concern for health and social ministry; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, The United Methodist Church has a nearly 250-year history of service in hospitals and ministries to older adults, children, youth, and families. Today there are over 400 such United Methodist-related health and welfare organizations; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, there is a growing recognition in scientific and medical literature of the role of faith in wellness and healing; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, numerous studies have documented that not-for-profit health care organizations provide higher-quality care; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, there is a growing recognition in management literature of the application of Christian principles in management and leadership; and <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, The United Methodist Association of Health and Welfare Ministries has a long tradition of promoting quality service, Christian leadership, and connection with Annual Conferences and local churches. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore The United Methodist Church calls upon: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthcare providers and government agencies to: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Devote needed resources to the promotion of quality healthcare. <br /> 2) Engage in programs of continuous quality improvement. <br /> 3) Recognize the role of faith in health and wellness. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; United Methodist related health and welfare institutions to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Maintain membership and participation in The United Methodist Association of Health and Welfare Ministries. ¶632.4.b (31)* <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2) Participate in EAGLE accreditation. ¶632.4.b (29)* <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3) Suggest that Annual Conferences address participation in these programs when updating covenant relationship statements. ¶632.4.b (27)* <br /> 4) Recruit and select paid and volunteer leadership which recognizes and values the church connection and the role of faith in health and wholeness. <br /> <br /> C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Annual Conference and local churches to: <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1) Encourage or require membership in the United Methodist Association of Health and Welfare Ministries when updating covenant relationship statements. ¶632.4.b (27)* <br /> 2) Encourage or require participation in EAGLE accreditation when updating covenant relationship statements. ¶632.4.b (29)* <br /> 3) Encourage awareness and utilization of United Methodist-related Health and Welfare ministries. ¶632.4.b (31)* <br /> * All citations are from the Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church, 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p></td>
