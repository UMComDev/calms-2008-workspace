<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>267. Civil Rights of Undocumented Workers<br> and Employee Benefits <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>It is a well known fact that the economy of this country depends on the labor of both documented and undocumented workers. They work in industries such as: agriculture, manufacturing, sweatshops, etc., and their contribution is indispensible. They deserve the right to a safe, secure, just working and living environment. Such a just working environment should include equitable living wages, health care, and other social benefits provided by public and private agencies. <br> Whereas, a great number of Hispano/Latino and other immigrants contribute significantly to the economy of the country and engage in the most difficult jobs; and,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, a great number of Hispano/Latino and other laborers are undocumented and are not paid equitable salaries; and, <br> Whereas, we recognize the work of those Hispano/Latino and other undocumented workers as essential for the economic growth of the nation; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, the USA PATRIOT ACT has created more fear and unjustly oppresses undocumented workers; and <br> Whereas, we recognize that injustices are committed against Hispano/Latino and other undocumented workers and that it is against God&rsquo;s will; <br> <i>Be it resolved, </i>that<i> </i>the General Conference requests the General Board of Church and Society to strongly advocate the United States government for the establishment of more just laws to protect and enforce the human and civil rights of undocumented workers. <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that the General Conference demand, by way of the General Board of Church and Society, that the government require employers provide adequate health care and encourage employers to provide other social benefits provided by public and private agencies. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 164<i>A</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
