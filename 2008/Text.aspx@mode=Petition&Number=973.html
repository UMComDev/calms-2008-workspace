Without initiating the written complaint process, the bishop or district superintendent may, at his/her option, request the cabinet to recommend, by at least a &#190; vote, a <i>medical review</i>&nbsp;of the subject clergy.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A medical review requires the following: 1) a hearing before the Executive Committee of the Board of Ordained Ministry to consider the recommendation of the cabinet, with notification of the subject pastor, at least 20 days in advance of the hearing. The provisions of Fair Process in this paragraph shall apply with this process; and 2) a 3/4 confirmation vote of the Executive Committee of the Board of Ordained Ministry.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If such votes are obtained, the subject clergy shall be required to undergo a complete medical examination with a licensed physician of the clergy&rsquo;s choice. The costs of this examination, beyond the reimbursement of the clergy&rsquo;s health protection policy, shall be borne by the Annual Conference. Failure of the subject clergy to undergo this examination may be treated as a chargeable offense.<br /> &nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The report of the medical examination in writing are to be given both to the subject clergy and to the Joint Committee on Incapacity, which shall hold the report in confidence. After reviewing the report of the medical examination, the Joint Committee on Incapacity may call the subject clergy in for consultation and make recommendations to assist the subject clergy to make responsible choices regarding his/her physical health. Within 120 days of the consultation, the chair of the Joint Committee on Incapacity shall send a written report to the Bishop and Cabinet, with copy to the subject clergy, informing them of whether an appropriate resolution and course of action has been achieved with the subject clergy. This report shall not include any of the specific medical information discovered in the review. <br /> </b></b></i></i></b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>To allow a confidential review of a clergy&rsquo;s physical health prior to undertaking an action that could lead to administrative complaint, in a way that keeps the clergy&rsquo;s medical information private and out of the hands of bodies that could be involved in future complaint process actions against the subject...<br /></p></td>
