The purpose of the fund is to provide financial support for current operating budgets and capital improvements of the Women&rsquo;s colleges related administratively to the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;These colleges currently include: Bennett College of Greensboro, North Carolina; Columbia College of Columbia, South Carolina; and Wesleyan College of Macon Georgia.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. The treasurer of the General Council on Finance and Administration shall remit monthly receipts for this fund to the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry for distribution to those Women&rsquo;s colleges whose eligibility under adopted guidelines of management, educational quality, and measurement by announced objectives shall be a precondition of participation. These guidelines and a formula for distribution shall be revised and administered by the Division of Higher Education of the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, in consultation with the Presidents of the Women&rsquo;s Colleges. The formula for distribution is as follows; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (1) a) 80 percent of the receipts of the fund shall be distributed to the colleges to assist in supporting their current operating budgets to be shared equally by each college. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b) 10 percent of the receipts shall be distributed equally to each college annually for long-range planning, special academic programs, and meeting challenge grants in complying with the guidelines for support established by the General Conference. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c) 10 percent of the fund receipts shall be set aside for capital improvements, to be distributed by the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry on the basis of need and matching funds. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (2) In the interim between sessions of the General Conference, the guidelines for support and formula for distribution may be changed as necessary upon recommendation of the Presidents of the Women&rsquo;s Colleges and the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry and with the consent of the General Council on Finance and Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3) Promotion of the Women&rsquo;s College Fund shall be by the Division of Higher Education and in consultation with the Presidents of the Women&rsquo;s colleges, in cooperation with and with the assistance of the General Commission on Communication, the cost being a charge against the Women&rsquo;s College Fund receipts and within a budget approved by the Division of Higher Education and the General Council on Finance and Administration. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (4) An annual conference may make direct and/or designated gifts for the purpose of current expense or capital funds to one or more of these colleges, but only after it has met its full Women&rsquo;s College Fund apportionment. There may be reasonable exceptions to this restriction, but such exceptions shall be negotiated with the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry prior to implementation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>See petition 81168. <br /></p></td>
