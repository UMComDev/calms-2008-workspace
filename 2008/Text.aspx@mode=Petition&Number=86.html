It is not part of any judicial process. At any meetings no verbatim record shall be made; no legal counsel shall be present; the person against whom the complaint was made may choose another person to accompany him or her with the right to voice; the person making the complaint shall have the right to choose a person to accompany him or her with the right to voice. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The supervisory response should be carried out by the bishop <strike> and</strike>&nbsp; <b>or </b>district superintendent<b>, or, at the bishop&rsquo;s sole discretion, by another elder assigned by the bishop,</b> <b>hereinafter referred to as the supervising elder. The supervising elder shall not be a member of the staff of any annual conference. The supervisory response should be conducted </b>in a confidential and timely manner, with attention to communication to all parties regarding the complaint and the process. At the determination of the bishop, <b>superintendent,</b> <b>or supervising elder</b>, persons with qualifications and experience in assessment, intervention, or healing may be selected to assist in the supervisory response. The bishop,<b> superintendent, or supervising elder </b>also may consult with the committee on pastor-parish relations for pastors, the district committee on superintendency for the district superintendents, appropriate personnel committee or other persons who may be helpful. The supervisory response may include a process that seeks a just resolution in which the parties are assisted by a trained, impartial third party facilitator(s) or mediator(s), in reaching an agreement satisfactory to all parties. The bishop<b>, superintendent,</b> <b>or supervising elder </b>and other appropriate persons shall enter into a written agreement outlining the process, including any agreements on confidentiality. If resolution is achieved, a written statement of resolution, including any terms and conditions, shall be signed by the parties and the parties shall agree on any matters to be disclosed to third parties. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A process seeking a just resolution may be begun at any time in the supervisory or complaint process. This is a not an administrative or judicial proceeding. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the supervisory response is initiated, the bishop<b>, superintendent,</b> <b>or supervising elder </b>shall notify the executive committee of the board of ordained ministry that a complaint has been filed, the clergyperson named, and the general nature of the complaint; and when concluded the disposition of the complaint.<br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Bishops spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with complaints against clergy, and this would provide those bishops who choose to use it an alternative method of dealing with those complaints that are administrative that would shift some of that work load, but not ultimate responsibility, to another elder.<br /></p></td>
