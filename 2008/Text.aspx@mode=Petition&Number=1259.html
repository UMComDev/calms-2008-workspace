The Council may remove the Presiding Bishop with or without cause on a vote of three-fourths of the Council present and voting. The Council shall by majority vote of members present and voting replace a Presiding Bishop for the remainder of his or her term in the event of an incumbent&rsquo;s death, resignation, removal, or inability to perform the duties of the office.</b><br /> Any provision in the Constitution in conflict with the foregoing is hereby amended to conform therewith. <br /> This amendment shall be self-executing.<br /></p></td>
