<b>provisional</b> member <b>in residency for two years following the completion of their educational requirements</b>, have been found by the Church to be of sound learning, of Christian character, possessing the necessary gifts and evidence of God&rsquo;s grace, and whose call by God to ordination has been confirmed by the Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Elders are ordained to a lifetime ministry of Service, Word, Sacrament and Order.&nbsp;&nbsp;They are authorized to preach and teach the Word of God, to administer the sacraments of baptism and Holy Communion, and to order the life of the Church for mission and ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;The servant leadership of the elder is expressed by leading the people of God in worship and prayer, by leading persons to faith in Jesus Christ, by exercising pastoral supervision in the congregation, and by leading the Church in obedience to mission in the world. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As members of the Order of Elder, all elders are in covenant with all other elders in the annual conference and shall participate in the life of their Order. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragraph 333</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A <strike> probationary member of the annual conference who has completed the requirements for Elder&rsquo;s Orders and admission into full membership shall be eligible for election to full membership and ordination as elder by the bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strike> Following election into full membership in the annual conference, the bishop and secretary of the conference shall provide a certificate of full membership in the annual conference<strike> , and following ordination, a certificate of ordination</strike> . <br /> Section XII.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mentoring and Mentors <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Paragraph 349.1 <br /> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b) </i>Clergy mentors are clergy in full connection, associate members, or full-time trained local pastors who have completed the Course of Study trained to provide ongoing oversight and counsel with local pastors and <strike> probationary</strike>&nbsp; <b>provisional</b> members pursuing ordained ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Local pastors will be assigned a clergy mentor by the district committee on ordained ministry in consultation with the district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike> Probationary</strike>&nbsp; <b>Provisional </b>members will be assigned a clergy mentor in full connection by the conference board of ordained ministry in consultation with the district superintendent.&nbsp;&nbsp;A candidacy mentor may continue with the same person if trained to serve as a clergy mentor. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conference board of ordained ministry may assign one mentor to work either with one individual or with a group of local pastors and/or <strike> probationary</strike>&nbsp; <b>provisional </b>members.&nbsp;&nbsp;Persons transferring from other denominations will also be assigned a clergy mentor. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clergy mentoring begins when a person receives an appointment as a local pastor or as a <strike> commissioned</strike>&nbsp; <b>ordained</b> minister entering <strike> probationary</strike>&nbsp; <b>provisional</b> service. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>The change suggests a clearer distinction between ordination and conference membership, eliminating the theologically and ecumenically problematic practice of &ldquo;commissioning&rdquo; and the negative connotation of &ldquo;probationary&rdquo; language.&nbsp;&nbsp;It restores the practice of ordination after seminary and shortens the time for admittance to full membership back to two years from three. <br /> <br /></p></td>
