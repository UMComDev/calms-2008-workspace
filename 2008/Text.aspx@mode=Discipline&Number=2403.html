<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>2403.<i> </b>Methodist Unity-</i>1<i>. World Methodist Council-a)</i> The United Methodist Church is a member of the World Methodist Council, its predecessor Methodist and Evangelical United Brethren churches having been charter members of such body. The council is a significant channel for United Methodist relationships with other Methodist churches and with autonomous Methodist churches, affiliated autonomous Methodist churches, affiliated united churches formerly part of The United Methodist Church or its predecessor denominations, and other churches with a Wesleyan heritage. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>b) </i>Each affiliated autonomous Methodist church and each affiliated united church that is a member of the World Methodist Council may choose to send delegates either to the General Conference as proposed in ¶¶&nbsp;571.3 and 570 or to the World Methodist Council (receiving from the General Administration Fund the expense of travel and per diem allowances thereto). But no such church shall be entitled to send delegations at the expense of the General Administration Fund to both the World Methodist Council and the General Conference. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <i>Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation and Union</i>-Given the relationship and shared history of the denominations of the Wesleyan tradition in America, there shall be a Commission on Pan-Methodist Cooperation and Union established jointly among The African Methodist Episcopal Church, The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, The Christian Methodist Episcopal Church, and The United Methodist Church. The membership of the commission shall consist of nine persons from each member denomination, with each denomination naming three bishops, three clergypersons, and three lay persons to include at least one young adult. <br> The commission shall work to define, determine, plan, and, in cooperation with established agencies of the several denominations, execute activities to foster meaningful cooperation among the four Methodist denominations and to explore possible union and related issues. Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, evangelism, missions, publications, social concerns, and higher education. Each denomination will pay the expenses of its delegation to participate in the work of the commission. The commission may develop one or more Pan-Methodist coalitions to further meaningful cooperation on a particular activity or issue. <br> Each quadrennium, the commission shall plan and convene a Consultation of Methodist Bishops. The commission shall report to each of its member denominations through their General Conferences. The commission may be expanded by the inclusion of other denominations of the Wesleyan tradition and the commission may establish guidelines to provide for such expansion. Before another Wesleyan or American Methodist denomination may become a part of the commission, it must have the approval of its general conference or equivalent. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;3. <i>Striving Toward Union</i>-As a result of our heritage as a part of a people called Methodist, The United Methodist Church commits itself to strive toward closer relationship with other Methodist or Wesleyan churches wherever they may be found (¶&nbsp;6). <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;
