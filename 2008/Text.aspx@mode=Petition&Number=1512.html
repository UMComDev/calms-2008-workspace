Water, air, soil, minerals, energy resources, plants, animal life, and space are to be valued and conserved because they are God's creation and not solely because they are useful to human beings. God has granted us stewardship of creation. We should meet these stewardship duties through acts of loving care and respect. Economic, political, social, and technological developments have increased our human numbers, and lengthened and enriched our lives. However, these developments have led to regional defoliation, dramatic extinction of species, massive human suffering, overpopulation, and misuse and over consumption of natural and nonrenewable resources, particularly by industrialized societies. This continued course of action jeopardizes the natural heritage that God has entrusted to all generations. Therefore, let us recognize the responsibility of the church and its members to place a high priority on changes in economic, political, social, and technological lifestyles to support a more ecologically equitable and sustainable world leading to a higher quality of life for all of God's creation.</b><br /> <b>Whereas, the continuing extreme climate change disruptions will lead to greater human suffering, and place all life systems in jeopardy <br /><br /> Whereas, the United States government is now creating Global Warming Legislation and responsible corporations are seriously looking at ways to continue their service without destroying our natural earth<br /><br /> Whereas, our cycle of economic violence in which the United States is engaged has created the denigration of the natural world which creates denigration of human dignity and spirit.<br /><br /> Therefore, We, The United Methodist Church: <br /> 1. Lament the continued destruction of the earth; and pray for guidance and insight. <br /> 2. Support state and Congressional legislation to immediately begin capping our use of green house gases. <br /> 3. Support state and Congressional legislation to require energy suppliers to immediately begin reducing reliance on fossil fuels and developing renewable sources of energy. <br /> 4. Call on President Bush to immediately begin to work with the United Nations in creating a worldwide plan for decreasing green house gases. <br /> 5. Commit to immediately reducing our carbon footprint by:&nbsp;&nbsp;turning off electrical items when not in use (lights, computers); turn down thermostats (by 2 degrees); turn down water heater settings (by 2 degrees); install energy-saving light bulbs; carpooling. <br /> (Conservation.org/carboncalculator.org or www. Carbonfootprint.com on the Internet will expand information)<br /> 6. Call all people throughout the world to stand up and speak out for public policies: that promote survival of all people; and, that protect the earth, water, air and life systems first.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></b></b></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This action is necessary because God created the earth and it was good.&nbsp;&nbsp;We have been ignoring the blessings of our very earth and destroying the gift that physically sustains all of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout Biblical history God has shown us that there are consequences for ignoring God&rsquo;s laws.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;The United...<br /></p></td>
