The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s strong support of the NCC reinforces the UMC&rsquo;s role as a part of the ecumenical movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;The NCC&rsquo;s five program commissions ensure that the NCC&rsquo;s founding goal of furthering Christian unity is advanced through a wide variety of approaches.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns (GCCUIC) has primary responsibility for the administration of the Interdenominational Cooperation Fund, which supports the works of the NCC. The General Commission, in cooperation with the General Council on Finance and Administration and the The Council of Bishops, monitors the financial status of all agencies that receive support from ICF dollars. The GCCUIC understands its role to be that of a steward for funds that are provided for the work of ecumenical organizations. The Book of Discipline ¶ 814.5 provides guidelines for the disbursement of funds to ecumenical organizations and outlines&nbsp;the consequences in the event that an organization fails to fulfill the funding provisions set by the GCCUIC.&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore be it resolved that the 2008 General Conference of The United Methodist Church affirm&nbsp;the General Commission on Christian Unity and Inter-religious Concern&rsquo;s stewardship of the &lsquo;Interdenominational Cooperation Fund,&rsquo; and oppose the arbitrary capping of or restricting the amount of funds that the GCCUIC may award to the NCC.</b><br /></p></td>
