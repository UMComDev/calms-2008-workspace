<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>133. Ecumenical Dialogues on the Native Community <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, in Methodism there has been a strong attraction toward native cultures, yet, at the same time, there has been an inherent desire to change, control, or destroy the traditional lifeways. As Christianity enters the third millennium since the birth of Jesus Christ, the church continues to be torn by the double legacy of both attraction and repulsion which was modeled by John Wesley over two-and-a-half centuries ago. <br> Whereas, historically, the churches have not known or understood the native people within and outside the church. However, native people had a sacred relationship with the Creator thousands of generations before the colonial imposition of Christianity. The church has had a long pattern of following the prevailing attitudes of U.S.A. society, rather than promoting attitudes of proper respect and support. This has resulted in a lack of understanding, harmony, balance, and healing among native communities. <br> Whereas, ecumenical dialogues bringing together native Christians including members of the native American church, traditional practitioners, and other spiritual and ceremonial leaders have been conducted by the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns in order to build bridges of understanding, respect, and healing of native communities; and <br> Whereas, in accordance with Scripture and a desire to bring Methodism into the modern-day life of native people, and to forge a means of protecting what remains of traditional lifeways, the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns has initiated a dialogue process; and <br> Whereas, in order to ensure a path toward the unity of generations, the General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns has worked with other ecumenical entities and communions to address the issues of power, prestige and privilege in relation to Native American communities and Native American leadership, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the 2000 General Conference: <br> 1. Urge local congregations of The United Methodist Church to engage in dialogue with a native community to begin a journey of understanding the native perspective of unresolved issues of identity, community, hostility, and empowerment. This dialogue will assist the church in its own understanding of responsibility to empower native families and communities by affirming native culture and tradition; and <br> 2. Call upon these partnerships to incorporate in these discussions the misappropriation and selling of native heritage and cultural ways. The consequences of these actions can be detrimental and lead to unacceptable practices within and outside the native community. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
