<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>355. Church Participation by a Registered Child Sex Offender <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The Social Principles of The United Methodist Church declare: &ldquo;We recognize that family violence and abuse in all its forms-verbal, psychological, physical, sexual-is detrimental to the covenant of the human community. We encourage the Church to provide a safe environment, counsel, and support for the victim. While we deplore the actions of the abuser, we affirm that person to be in need of God&rsquo;s redeeming love.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Increasingly, churches are faced with a dilemma in their attempt to be faithful to both of the last two sentences above. Assuring the safety of children in our care, our facilities and our programs is a sacred duty. We must weigh that duty in the balance with what often seems the conflicting value of participation in the life of the church by a convicted child abuser. Being part of a worshiping community is not the only way for a person to experience God&rsquo;s redeeming love, but it is an important one.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Recent studies suggest a low likelihood that pedophiles can or will change. Without extensive professional treatment, virtually all child sexual offenders will re-offend. Repentance, prayer, and pastoral support, always in combination with lifelong professional treatment, can be crucial in helping to change behavior but, in themselves, offer slim hope of changing the behavior of perpetrators. Welcoming a child sex offender into a congregation must be accompanied by thorough knowledge, careful planning, and long-term monitoring. <br> A convicted and/or registered sex offender who wishes to be part of a church community should expect to have conditions placed on his or her participation. Indeed, offenders who have been in treatment and are truly committed to living a life free of further abuse will be the first to declare that, in order to accomplish that, they must structure a life that includes on-going treatment, accountability mechanisms, and lack of access to children.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> The following steps should be taken in order to be faithful to the Social Principles&rsquo; commitment both to safety from abuse and to ministry with abusers: <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><i>A. Local churches should: <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>hold discussions in the church council and in adult education settings about the possibility of facing the situation of a convicted sex offender returning to or joining the church. These discussions should be held and general agreements reached about actions to be taken should the church find itself in this circumstance; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> develop a carefully constructed and openly negotiated covenant between the offender and the church community. The covenant should include agreements in the following areas: participation in a professional counseling program for at least the entire time of church membership or participation; adult &ldquo;covenant partners&rdquo; to accompany the offender while on church property or attending church activities; areas of church facilities that are &ldquo;off limits;&rdquo; restrictions on leadership in or on behalf of church; no role in church that includes contact with children or youth; any additional conditions for presence or participation; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> assure that the covenant is maintained by having it written and signed by the offender, the pastor(s), and the chairperson of the church council. While confidentiality of victims should be respected, the covenant should not be secret. Monitoring of the covenant should be taken seriously as a permanent responsibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B. Annual conferences should: <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li><li>develop similar plans and covenant for situations in which a convicted and/or registered sexual offender is involved or seeks involvement in the conference, its activities or facilities; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; include information about this concern and assistance with implementation of this resolution in its training and resourcing of clergy and local church lay leaders; <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C. The General Board of Discipleship and the General Board of Global Ministries should: <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>cooperatively develop and promote a process and specific guidelines to assist congregations in the education and covenant tasks outlined above. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p>&nbsp; </b>
