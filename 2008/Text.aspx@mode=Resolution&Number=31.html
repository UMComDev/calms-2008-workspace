<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>31. Indochinese-American Ministries <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the US has joined many countries around the world in opening their homes and their lands to the refugees from Indochina. There are 450,000 Cambodian, 350,000 Hmong and Laotian, and over 13 million Vietnamese-Americans in the US at the present time; and <br> Whereas, there was no official Methodist ministry in the three countries of Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam in Indochina before 1975 Through the resettlement process, the UM local churches and their members have opened their hearts and their homes to welcome refugees from Indochina. As of September 1999, there are twelve Cambodian fellowships and congregations, eleven Hmong fellowships and congregations, three Laotian fellowships, and nineteen Vietnamese fellowships and congregations. This was made possible through the loving care, support, and witness in words and deeds of the UM local churches, their members, and with the seeds from Vietnamese Christians of other denominations in Vietnam and strong support of the annual conferences, general boards, and agencies; and <br> &nbsp; Whereas, there are six ordained Hmong, two ordained Laotian, one ordained Cambodian, and thirteen ordained Vietnamese UM clergy; and <br> Whereas, more ordained clergy are needed as in: one Cambodian, ten Hmong, three Laotian and twenty Vietnamese to meet the urgent needs of new congregational growth; and <br> Whereas, there are more opportunities for newcomers to open their hearts and minds to the gospel than when they are well settled and especially more chance for the first generation to listen to the good news of our Lord than the second or third generations, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the General Conference of the UMC celebrate God&rsquo;s wonderful grace, blessings, and providence through these new emerging Indochinese-American ministries in the last twenty-five years; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the 2000 General Conference commends local churches, annual conferences, general boards, and agencies in their effort to reach out to these new groups; <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the 2000 General Conference highly recommend annual conferences, general boards, and agencies to make further efforts in congregational development, training in church and society outreach, preparing Sunday School materials, worship materials, and literature as well as conducting leadership training and recruitment for both Indochinese-American lay and clergy in order to meet the urgent needs of the forty-five fellowships and congregations at the present time and the goal for thirty more in the next ten years. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 161. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
