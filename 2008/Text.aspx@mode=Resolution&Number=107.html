<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>107. Communications Access for People Who Have Hearing<br> and Sight Impairment <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Because The United Methodist Church believes that all United Methodists are full members of the church and is committed to ministry by and with people with disabilities; and <br> Public accommodations such as restaurants, hotels, theaters, doctors&rsquo; offices, pharmacies, retail stores, museums, libraries, parks, private schools, and daycare centers may not discriminate on the basis of disability, effective January 26, 1992. <br> Auxiliary aids and services must be provided to individuals with vision or hearing impairments or other individuals with disabilities so that they can have an equal opportunity to benefit, unless an undue burden would result. (from a synopsis prepared by the Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice) <br> And because, despite sincere efforts on the part of the church, people with disabilities are still confronted by barriers to communications within the church; <br> <i>We call upon the church to:</i><br> 1. increase its awareness; and <br> 2. use appropriate technologies to make essential communications accessible to people who are deaf and hearing impaired, including: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; considering production of alternative versions of church-produced video, films, or other audiovisuals at meetings for people who are deaf or hearing impaired, and people who are blind or partially sighted; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; considering the use of assistive technologies in telephone com-munications for persons who are deaf or hearing impaired. <br> <p align="right"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ADOPTED 1992<br> AMENDED and READOPTED 1996<br> Readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>G</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
