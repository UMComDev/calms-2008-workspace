Support and Protection of Rural People <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, rural people, rural communities and rural congregations are of great value in God&rsquo;s creation and have many gifts and strengths to share with the world community; and <br> Whereas, farming, ranching, other agricultural endeavors, trucking, migrant work, timbering, recreation, fishing and river work, rural factories, and small businesses of numerous kinds, as elements of rural life, undergird the economy of the world; and <br> Whereas, rural people contribute to the abundance of our world economy, but often do not receive benefits commensurate with their efforts; and <br> Whereas, developments in communication technology and improved transportation systems have done much to eliminate problems of isolation and distance in some parts of the world, while further isolating people from each other in other parts of the world; and <br> Whereas, the health and well-being of God&rsquo;s creation rests upon the vitality of our worldwide rural people who are caretakers of the land, water, and air; and <br> Whereas, The United Methodist Church, recognizing the sacredness of creation care, has a long history of ministry within rural places throughout the world; <br> T<i>herefore be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church, as it is in ministry in rural places, affirms that: <br> 1. rural residents around the world deserve the option of living and prospering in the communities where they live, and the goals and policies of the governments that relate to rural places should provide this option; <br> 2. rural people around the world deserve a sense of purpose and authentic hope, equitable and continuing spiritual care; satisfying economic opportunity to meet basic needs for food, clothing, and shelter; nurture and protection for children and youth; security for the elderly and those who abilities are challenged; equitable access to affordable health care and education; and opportunities for recreation and spiritual renewal; <br> &nbsp; 3. as stewards of creation, rural people around the world have a right to determine how land, water, air, and other resources within their communities, especially in areas of limited population, are to be used, with particular attention given to land use and control being exercised by all who live within an area and/or own land within a given area while respecting the legal rights of owners of real property. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>N</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
