Incapacity Leave Resulting From Health Matters and Disabling Conditions <br /> </b></i>1. When clergy who are members of an annual conference (¶ 368) are unable to perform their ministerial work because of incapacity due to health matters and disabling conditions, upon recommendations of the conference board of ordained ministry and the conference board of pensions, and by a majority vote of the executive session of clergy members in full connection with the annual conference who are present and voting, they may be granted annual incapacity leave without losing their relationship to the annual conference; provided, however, that such leave may be granted or renewed <strike> only after a thorough</strike>&nbsp; <b>upon reasonable and appropriate</b> investigation of the case by the joint committee on incapacity of the annual conference,<b> or the party responsible for managing the incapacity of clergy in accordance with the annual conference&rsquo;s policies</b>, which will report its findings to the conference board of ordained ministry and the conference board of pensions.... <br /> 2. When clergy who are members of an annual conference are unable to perform their ministerial work between sessions of the annual conference on account of health matters and disabling conditions, with the approval of a majority of the district superintendents, after consultation with the executive committee of the conference board of ordained ministry and the executive committee of the conference board of pensions, an incapacity leave may be granted by the bishop for the remainder of the conference year; provided, however, that such leave may be granted <strike> only after a thorough</strike>&nbsp; <b>upon reasonable and appropriate</b> investigation of the case including accommodation provisions by the joint committee on incapacity of the annual conference<b>, or the party responsible for managing the incapacity of clergy in accordance with the annual conference&rsquo;s policies</b>; which will report its findings to the conference board of ordained ministry and the conference board of pensions....<br /></b></b></i></i></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Proposed ¶651 amendment appears to also call for some minor editing in ¶358.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attached is our suggestion for possible wording, to support the proposed ¶651 changes that could make the committee optional at conference discretion and remove some of the medical determination language that is no longer relevant or appropriate.<br /></p></td>
