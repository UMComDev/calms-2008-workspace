Cooperative ministries may be expressed in one or more of the forms contained in the following categories. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Beginning and Exploratory Forms:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1.</i> <i>Cluster Groups&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&ndash;a group of churches located in the same geographic area with a loosely knit organization that allows the participating congregations and pastoral charges to engage in cooperative programs in varying degrees.&nbsp;&nbsp;A district may be divided into cluster groups for administrative purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>2.</i> <i>Probe Staff </i>&ndash; composed of the pastors and other staff assigned to a geographic area to explore possibilities for cooperation and developing strategies for improving ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>3.</i> <i>Group Ministry </i>&ndash; a loosely organized group of two or more pastoral charges in which pastors are appointed or assigned to charges.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors and/or lay council representing all churches may designate a coordinator.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> b) Structured Forms:<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Multiple Charge Parishes </i>&ndash; intentionally organized group of two or more pastoral charges in which each church continues to relate to its charge conference on the organizational level and also participates in a parish-wide council.&nbsp;&nbsp;The pastors are appointed or assigned to the charges and also to the parish, and a director or coordinator is appointed or assigned by the bishop.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. Larger Parish </i>&ndash; a number of congregations working together using a parish-wide council and other committees and work groups, as the parish may determine which provides representation on boards and committees from all churches; guided by a constitution or covenant and served by a staff appointed or assigned by the bishop and involving a director.&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>3. Blended Ministry </i>&ndash; the merging of the organizations and memberships of churches spread throughout a defined geographical area into one congregation that intentionally develops two or more worship/program centers, and for which there is one charge conference and one set of committees and other groups, guided by a covenant and served by a staff and a director appointed or assigned to the parish by the bishop. <br /> c) Specialized Forms:&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>1. Enlarged Charge</i> &ndash; two or more congregations, usually on the same charge and of relatively equal size that work as a unit with the leadership of one or more pastors.&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be a charge council and appropriate committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>2. Extended or Shared Ministry </i>&ndash; a larger membership church sharing ministry with a smaller membership church, usually served by the pastor(s) of the larger church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>3. Cooperative Ecumenical Parish </i>&ndash; two or more local churches of different Christian traditions including a United Methodist congregation, working together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either of the above forms may be utilized<i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Shared Facilities</i> &ndash; two or more congregations, one of which shall be United Methodist, sharing a building, office equipment, etc., such as congregations which use different languages or which are of different racial/ethnic/cultural groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;The congregations may enter into a covenant that ensures representation and preserves the autonomy of each congregation on such bodies as church councils, boards of trustees and other committees and work groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;The congregations shall negotiate a financial agreement about the use of the facility in order to provide&nbsp;&nbsp;appropriate financial support.</b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This proposed substitution reorganizes current ¶206.3 to reflect cooperative parish ministry as it has evolved over the past 20 years and is currently practiced.&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition it lays out the same information in an easier to follow progression.<br /></p></td>
