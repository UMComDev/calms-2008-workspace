(The change in name from &ldquo;central&rdquo; to &ldquo;regional&rdquo; takes effect January 1, 2013 at which time this parenthetical procedural note will be removed from the Constitution.) <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>General Conference should be able to create similar structures for all of our world-wide church. Each Annual Conference should belong to a Regional Conference which should be able to organize sub-units called Jurisdictional Conferences. Further study is needed to explore how to live more fully into our world-wide nature. <br /> <br /></p></td>
