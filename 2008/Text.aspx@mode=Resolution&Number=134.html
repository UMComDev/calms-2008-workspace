Health Care for Native Americans <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, Native Americans are the most socio-economically deprived minority group in the United States; and <br> Whereas, the United States government is bound by treaty to provide health care for all Native Americans; and <br> Whereas, the United States government now provides these medical services through Indian Health Services, United States Public Health Service, Department of Health and Human Services; and <br> Whereas, medical services currently provided by the Indian Health Services for health education and prenatal care have contributed to a rapid decline in infant mortality among Native Americans; and <br> Whereas, similar successes of these health programs are likely to have occurred for all Native Americans living in the United States; and <br> Whereas, despite these successes, the federal government is constantly threatening to cut the Indian Health Services Program; and <br> Whereas, any funding cuts could severely curtail or cancel health care for a large number of eligible Native Americans; and <br> Whereas, a small number of Native Americans can afford to buy private health insurance, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that all Native Americans have access to adequate medical services to ensure a balance of physical, mental, and spiritual well-being for the &ldquo;Journey Toward Wholeness&rdquo;; and that the United States Congress allows no decrease in federal funds to operate Indian health facilities. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Board of Church and Society submit this resolution, on behalf of the General Conference, to all United States senators and legislators who have Indian Health Services within their respective state. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1988<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
