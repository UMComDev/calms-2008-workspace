<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>281. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Regulation of Tobacco <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, The United Methodist Church historically has opposed the use of tobacco products and their devices in the Social Principles ¶ 162<i>K</i>: <br> &ldquo;We affirm our historic tradition of high standards of personal discipline and social responsibility. In light of the overwhelming evidence that tobacco smoking and the use of smokeless tobacco are hazardous to the health of all ages, we recommend total abstinence from the use of tobacco. We urge that our educational and communication resources be utilized to support and encourage such abstinence. Further, we recognize the harmful effects of passive smoke and support the restriction of smoking in public areas and workplaces.&rdquo;<br> Whereas, the sixth commandment says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not kill&rdquo;; <br> Whereas, the medical community and surgeon general have known the causal effects of tobacco and disease and death for over fifty years; <br> Whereas, annually more than 450,000 people in the United States die because of the over 240 cancer-causing ingredients in tobacco products and their devices and their products of combustion. This is equivalent to all the American casualties in all the wars of the 20</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;century occurring every eighteen months and the same number of casualties of Sept. 11, 2001 occurring every three days; <br> Whereas, the Congress of the United States has intentionally maintained for itself the authority to regulate the ingredients in tobacco products, their devices, and their products of combustion; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved, </i>that the General Conference of The United Methodist Church strongly urges the members of Congress to provide the authority to the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the ingredients of tobacco products, their devices, and their products of combustion in order to render harmless the greatest menace to human life in our country&rsquo;s history. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶¶ 162<i>J</i> and <i>K</i> and 164. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
