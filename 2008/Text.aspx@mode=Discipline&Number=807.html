When the use to be made of any such donation, bequest, or devise is not otherwise designated, the same shall be added to and become a part of the &ldquo;Permanent Fund&rdquo; of The United Methodist Church.

To make recommendations to the General Conference, in consultation with the Connectional Table and the Council of Bishops, regarding any offerings to be received in connection with special days observed on a churchwide basis. These recommendations shall include the number and timing of such special days with offerings, the amount, if any, to be established as a goal for each such offering, the causes to be benefited by each, the method by which the receipts on each such offering shall be distributed among the causes benefiting from it, and the method by which such receipts shall be remitted and reported by local churches. All such recommendations are subject to the approval of the General Conference. <br> 6. To establish general policy governing the ownership, sale, rental, renovation, or purchase of property by a general agency in the United States.
