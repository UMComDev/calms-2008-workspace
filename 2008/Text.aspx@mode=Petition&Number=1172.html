<br /> In the November 9, 2001 cover story of the Indian magazine, Frontline, Nobel Laureate Amartya Sen wrote that &ldquo;sex-selective abortion&rdquo; is &ldquo;particularly prevalent in East Asia, in China and South Korea in particular, but also in Singapore and Taiwan, and it is beginning to emerge as a statistically significant phenomenon in India and South Asia as well.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> A 1998 study published by&nbsp;the Alan Guttmacher Institute, which was founded as a division of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, also lists Thailand among the nations in which &ldquo;sex selection is believed to play a role in abortion.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> Jyotsna Patro, an Indian delegate to the Asian Church Women's Conference and former president of the Church of North India Women's Fellowship, has recently reported that &ldquo;[t]he callousness in allowing female feticide is worsening,&rdquo; with &ldquo;[p]arents hav[ing] no qualms about aborting female fetuses.&rdquo;<br /> The widespread practice of sex-selective abortion is believed to be a main cause of the extremely skewed sex ratios at birth in India, where it was recently estimated that only&nbsp;&nbsp;882 girls are born for every 1,000 boys, and China, where 832 girls are born for every 1,000 boys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> While precise estimates vary, there are now tens of millions of &ldquo;missing women&rdquo; in the world thanks to sex-selective abortions.&nbsp;&nbsp;In India alone, about 10 million female fetuses are estimated to have been selectively aborted in the last two decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voice of America news service recently reported that &ldquo;by the year 2020,&rdquo; China is expected to &ldquo;have 30 million more men than women, making it difficult for many men to find wives.&rdquo;&nbsp; Chinese population expert Chu Junhong has reported that &ldquo;[p]renatal sex selection was probably the primary cause, if not the sole cause, for the continuous rise of the sex ratio at birth&rdquo; in China since the implementation of that country&rsquo;s one-child policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;These growing gender imbalances are believed to exacerbate such problems as prostitution and human trafficking.&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, according to Dr. Therese Hesketh, a researcher at the University College London Institute of Child Health and co-author of a recent study on societal gender imbalances, this emergence of large numbers of young men unable to find wives &ldquo;could lead to increased levels of antisocial behavior and violence.&rdquo;<br />At the March 2007 meeting of the United Nation&rsquo;s Commission on the Status of Women, in New York,&nbsp;&nbsp;a resolution supported by the South Korea, United States, and others would have condemned sex-selective abortion and infanticide and encouraged&nbsp;steps to eliminate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the resolution was ultimately not adopted.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> The United Methodist Social Principles affirm &ldquo;[o]ur belief in the sanctity of unborn human life&rdquo; and &ldquo;unconditionally reject&rdquo; abortion being used &ldquo;as a means of gender selection&rdquo; (Â¶161J).&nbsp;&nbsp;While the members of our denomination are not of one mind over the precise conditions in which abortion can be supported, we cannot support abortion for such trivial reasons as not preferring the gender of the fetus.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> The widespread practice of sex-selective-abortion horribly treats females as inferior before they are even born.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is absolutely contrary to The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s long history of championing the Biblical principle of gender equality.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that the General Conference of The United Methodist Church strongly condemns sex-selective abortion as a particularly lamentable and violent expression of sexism.&nbsp;&nbsp;We call on religious, government, and community leaders to proactively pursue humane means for stopping the practice of sex-selective abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Board of Church and Society is encouraged to seek out and take advantage of opportunities to make this concern of our church known to national leaders of the United States and of other nations. <br /> </b></b></b>&nbsp;Amartya Sen, &ldquo;Many Faces of Gender Inequality,&rdquo;
