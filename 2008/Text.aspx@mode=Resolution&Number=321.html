Empowering and Equipping Young Indochinese Americans<br> for the Future <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, the United States has joined many countries around the world to open their homes and their lands to the refugees from Indochina. There are 450,000 Cambodian, 350,000 Hmong and Laotian, and over 1.5 million Vietnamese Americans in the United States at the present time; and as of November 2003, there are nine (9) Cambodian fellowships and congregations, twelve (12) Hmong fellowships and congregations, three (3) Laotian fellowships, and twenty-one (21) Vietnamese fellowships and congregations; and there are only nine (9) Cambodian pastors with one (1) ordained; fourteen (12) Hmong pastors with seven (5) ordained; three (3) Laotian pastors with two (2) ordained; and twenty-seven (27) Vietnamese pastors and eighteen (18) ordained United Methodist clergy, <br> Whereas, the children of Indochinese immigrants who were born or grew up in America do not sufficiently understand the language and culture of the parents and their local churches; and lack of communication and understanding between children and parents, and youths and adults in the church has had a negative impact on the<br> spiritual, emotional and intellectual development of the younger<br> generations; <br> Whereas, many Indochinese youths and young adults left the church due to the linguistic, cultural and generational gaps, and a sense of disempowerment; a significant number of teenagers and young adults with unmet needs are looking for support and nurture outside the church, with some dropping out of school, joining youth gangs, engaging in criminal activities or becoming drug addicts, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved, </i>that the General Conference of The United Methodist Church celebrate God&rsquo;s wonderful grace, blessings, and providence through this emerging Indochinese American ministries in the last twenty-nine years and acknowledge the urgent needs of English-speaking ministries to the Indochinese youths and young adults and the importance of continuing leadership training in order to mobilize, disciple, empower, and equip the young people to become influential leaders in church and society, <br> <i>Be it further resolved</i>, that the 2004 General Conference commend local churches, annual conferences, general boards and agencies in their efforts to reach out to Indochinese youths and young adults. <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that the 2004 General Conference highly recommend annual conferences, general boards and agencies to allocate funds, personnel, and resources to empower the Indochinese National Caucus and local churches in their efforts to minister to, disciple and train the young people for the future. <br> &nbsp; <p align="right">Indochinese National Caucus <br> November 2003 <br> <p align="right"><b>Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
