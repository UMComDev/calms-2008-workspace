If any Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor is not able to or does not make the further Contributions required of it by the Funding Policy, the Administrator will account for any delinquent Contributions (including market rate interest thereon) and will take reasonable steps to attempt to collect the delinquent amounts, including offsetting against any amounts that such delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor may have on deposit with the Administrator. Meanwhile, the Common Funding Pool will pay all benefits of the Consolidated DB Plan attributable to such Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor as they come due. All other Church Funds Agencies will remain obligated to make needed Contributions required by the Funding Policy, which may include a portion of the Contributions due from the delinquent Church Funds Agency Plan Sponsor.
