May we not be of one heart, though we are not of one opinion? Without all doubt, we may. Herein all the children of God may unite, notwithstanding these smaller differences.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>See </i>Discipline ¶102 (&ldquo;Doctrinal History&rdquo;).</sub><sup>2 <br /> </sup></sub><br /> </b></b>Diversity is a gift of the Holy Spirit, as Scripture reveals.&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Paul wrote: <br /> &ldquo;Let us therefore no longer pass judgment on one another, but resolve instead never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of another. I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself; but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.&rdquo; (Romans 14:13-14) <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />  Further, the writer of Acts 10:15b says: &ldquo;What God has made clean, you must not call unclean.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;St. Paul, in 1 Corinthians 12:13a, goes on to say: <br /> &ldquo;For in the one Spirit we were all baptized into one body.&rdquo;<br />  <br /> And again in Galatians 3:28 he says:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;There is no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The Gospel of John (13:35) sums it up:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &ldquo;[E]veryone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." <br /> <br /> The Church will not be at peace or at rest until it ceases the process of exclusion, and instead turns its whole heart and whole mind to an inclusive invitation to Christian discipleship.&nbsp;&nbsp;Deleting 35 years of exclusion language regarding sexual orientation and gender identity is a necessary starting point.</b><br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;See that none of you repays evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to all. . . .&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not quench the Spirit.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1 Thessalonians 5:15, 19) <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /></p></td>
