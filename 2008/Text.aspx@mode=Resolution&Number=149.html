<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>149. Native American Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative</b><br> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp; Whereas, prior to European contact the indigenous nations of this continent were sovereign, autonomous and self-regulating; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Whereas, prior to the American Revolution, the sovereign status of indigenous nations was recognized through nation-to-nation relationships with the major European powers. These relationships were maintained with the newly formed American government, who formulated 371 treaties with Indian nations between 1778-1871; and <br> Whereas, these treaties were and are regarded as sacred and enduring texts by American Indians and Alaska Natives, as sacred and enduring as the U. S. Constitution and Bill of Rights are to all American citizens. Therefore, it was disturbing that the U.S government could ignore their trust responsibilities through the violation of treaties and other promises; and <br> Whereas, indigenous persons were once sole occupants of this continent and estimated to number 10 million or more north of Mexico, their land base has been decimated to 2.3 percent of the U.S., and, according to the 2000 census, their population to 2.4 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;This decimation was rationalized according to (a) the European belief in their &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of the new world, (b) the arrogance of manifest destiny and (c) the egregious destruction of the Native concept of tribal communal land; and <br> Whereas, tribal sovereignty is understood as an inherent international right of Native nations, and it encompasses various matters, such as jurisdiction over Indians <i>and </i>non-Indians on tribal lands, education and language, child welfare and religious freedom. Land is both the physical and spiritual foundation of tribal identity, as stated by Kidwell, Noley and Tinker (2001) in <i>A Native American Theology:</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Land is today the basis upon which tribal sovereignty rests, the rights of Indian people to live upon, use and to govern in a political sense the members of the tribe who live on the land and those whose tribal membership gives them an association with it&rdquo; (p. 15); and <br> Whereas, early U.S. Supreme Court decisions support and affirm tribal sovereignty, most notably the Marshall trilogy of cases in the 19</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;century, and Winter v. S.&nbsp;&nbsp;(1908).&nbsp;&nbsp;Most recent Court decisions have contradicted earlier rulings and undermine tribal sovereignty; and <br> Whereas, a recently conducted survey by an independent research firm demonstrates that 75 percent of the American public supports tribal government over Native lands, and 74 percent believe that federal and state officials should make tribal self-government a priority; and <br> Whereas, in <i>The Book of Resolutions</i>, Resolution 144 calls that support be furnished for the rights of Native people according to the following points (relative to self-determination and sovereignty): <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>The right of Native people to be self-determining, and make their own decisions; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> The right of Native people to plan for a future in this nation, and to expect a fulfillment of commitments that have been made previously by the government, as well as equitable treatment of those who were not afforded legal protection for their culture and lands; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> The right of Native nations to exercise their sovereignty consistent with treaty provisions; and <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas, the National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) has appealed to religious institutions and their congregations to urge the moral responsibility of the U.S. government in upholding treaty obligations and trust responsibilities to Native peoples.&nbsp;&nbsp;NCAI has promulgated the Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative as a proactive effort in light of recent threats to tribal sovereignty from the federal government, including a conservative Supreme Court; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church affirms all aspects of Resolution 144; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that, in response to the NCAI appeal and the Tribal Sovereignty Protection Initiative, The United Methodist Church hereby urges the moral responsibility of the United States government and calls upon governmental agencies and entities within the United States to uphold and honor all treaty obligations and trust responsibilities to Native peoples; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that the Council of Bishops and the General Board of Church and Society, in consultation with the United Methodist Native American International Caucus (NAIC) and the National United Methodist Native American Center (NUMNAC), present this resolution to the NCAI Executive Director, the NCAI President, the Senators and Representatives of the United States Congress, the President of the United States, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs, and the United Methodist Jurisdictional Task Forces on Native American Ministries; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church hereby urges all clergy and laity to educate themselves and their congregations about historical and contemporary aspects of tribal sovereignty, including action steps that concerned individuals and congregations can take to support American Indians and Alaska and Hawaiian Natives.
