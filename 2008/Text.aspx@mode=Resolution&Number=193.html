<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER>THE ECONOMIC COMMUNITY <br> </CENTER><CENTER><b>Appalachia <br> </b></b></CENTER><CENTER>193. Appalachia: A Call to Action <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The General Conference of 1972 directed its boards, agencies and conferences to coordinate denominational and ecumenical ministries within the Appalachian region through the United Methodist Appalachian Ministry Network (UMAMN), and the Commission on Religion in Appalachia (CORA). The region encompasses 23 United States Annual Conferences that span more than 400 counties in 13 states. <br> The United Methodist Church is called upon to reaffirm its commitments to integrated strategies for mission and ministry in the region and to work denominationally and ecumenically to be present with and supportive of the people and churches of Appalachia by directing its boards, commissions, annual conferences and local churches to examine ways that they might address the systemic issues that contribute to the ongoing plight and exploitation of the people and land of Appalachia.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> This can be accomplished by studying the history, culture, social and economic realities of the region called Appalachia: developing opportunities for involvement in mission and ministry in Appalachian communities, enhancing spiritual renewal, addressing social recovery, developing leadership opportunities, working toward economic transformation through advocacy and economic development, securing environmental integrity, promoting political involvement and responsibility, and ministering with compassion. <br> In recent years, bishops in the Appalachian region of The<br> United Methodist Church have joined with other religious leaders and Roman Catholic bishops of Appalachia in producing pastoral<br> letters calling attention to the continued exploitation of the people and of the land.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <p align="right"><b>Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See </i>Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>B. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
