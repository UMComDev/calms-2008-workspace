<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>154. United Methodist Global AIDS Fund Distribution <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, for twenty years the General Conference of The United Methodist Church has spoken with prophetic compassion to the global issue of HIV/AIDS. Our resolutions, however, have not been matched by a resolve to commit significant financial and denominational resources in the struggle for education, prevention, treatment and care in the worldwide struggle against HIV/AIDS; and <br> Whereas, the United Nations has now declared the pandemic a &ldquo;global emergency,&rdquo; saying human life is threatened everywhere and world security is at risk as the planet faces the worst health crisis in 700 years; and <br> Whereas, with 42 million people infected, more than 20 million already deceased, and 16,000 new infections daily, the leaders of all the nations in the world unanimously asked faith-based organizations to join them in the battle to save human life; and <br> Whereas, to date the response of Christians, including United Methodists, has been minimal, particularly in comparison to our resources and other commitments; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved, </i>that the 2004 General Conference commits itself to establishing the United Methodist Global AIDS Fund (UMGAF). During the 2005-2008 quadrennium, United Methodists will raise $3 million through apportionments and match this with an additional $5 million through Advance gifts; <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that of the total money raised in each annual conference for UMGAF, 25 percent shall be retained by the annual conference that raised it, to be used in programs combating HIV/AIDS in their region and in other global connectional projects. Each annual conference shall designate an appropriate agency for the promotion and distribution of these funds. <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that of the total money raised in each annual conference for the United Methodist Global AIDS Fund, 75 percent shall be remitted by the conference treasurer to the treasurer of the General Council on Finance and Administration for distribution to a new Global AIDS Initiatives Committee (with no more than ten total representatives from the General Board of Global Ministries, Council of Bishops, General Board of Church and Society, Youth and Young Adults Ministries, and three persons not serving with any of these agencies). <br> <i>Be it further resolved, </i>that this Global AIDS Initiatives Committee will be responsible for the promotion, use, supervision and distribution of these funds. The United Methodist Global AIDS Fund will: <br> 1. assist local congregations and conferences in identifying and creating global partnerships for mutual HIV/AIDS ministry; <br> 2. provide support for projects sponsored by local congregations or organizations related to The United Methodist Church, partner autonomous Methodist churches and the ecumenical church; <br> 3. encourage partnerships between congregations and conferences in the United States and Methodist congregations and ecumenical organizations globally that are engaged in the struggle against HIV/AIDS; <br> 4. advocate for social justice, particularly related to increasing governmental and non-governmental funding and issues regarding the role of pharmaceutical companies; <br> 5. develop appropriate promotional materials and funding guidelines; and <br> 6. Engage the leadership of a person with appropriate skills for a special global AIDS assignment (#4091c). <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>S</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
