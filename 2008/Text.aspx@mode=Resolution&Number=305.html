<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>305. Aid for Taiwan <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, a catastrophic earthquake struck the Island of Taiwan on September 21, 1999, killing over 3,000, and injuring more than 10,000 people, destroying hundreds of high-rise buildings and thousands of homes in the affected areas; and <br> Whereas, amid the shock, grief, and turmoil in the aftermath of the earthquake disaster, the people of Taiwan stood in solidarity; government, military, emergency services, local organizations, religious groups, and others worked tirelessly, side by side, united in common purpose, and the response of the international community was overwhelmingly supportive; and <br> Whereas, China behaved in a most imperious way while Taiwan was trying to cope with this national tragedy, hindering international humanitarian response; while words of condolences and offer of aid from China was being reported, the arrival of the Russian rescue team was delayed because the government of China would not grant them permission to use their airspace, and the Red Cross of China warned the Red Cross of the world community not to help Taiwan unless they went through their &ldquo;official&rdquo; channels, thus adding insult to injury; and <br> Whereas, the UN Secretary-General announced it sought &ldquo;permission&rdquo; from China to enter and aid one of its provinces-Taiwan-and consequently, the UN&rsquo;s international organization&rsquo;s disaster-response coordinating effort was delayed while UN officials arranged to discuss the matter with the Chinese diplomats; and <br> Whereas, the Chinese government pointedly expressed thanks to the countries for helping &ldquo;their people&rdquo; in &ldquo;the Taiwan province.&rdquo; These actions contradicted China&rsquo;s public expression of sympathy towards a country devastated by the earthquake, proving to be an affront to Taiwan and the international communities&rsquo; expressions of pain and grief, <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that The United Methodist Church: <br> 1. expresses deep disappointment that China sought to assert its political right over Taiwan, when the latter was suffering from devastation caused by the earthquake in September, 1999; <br> 2. expresses its profound sympathy for the victims of the earthquake in Taiwan and affirms its willingness to render assistance towards their reconstruction efforts; and <br> 3. affirms its strong support for the security of Taiwan and for the self-determination of the people for Taiwan&rsquo;s political future. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165<i>B</i> and <i>C.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
