When we take account of both fiduciary obligations (including financial returns) and denominational values (including social returns), we are investing in a socially responsible manner. <br /> The Church&rsquo;s investment philosophy is based on the biblical concept that all resources are God-given and can be used to promote the reign of God on earth. <br /> Economic Witness in the Wesleyan Tradition <br /> Churches in the Wesleyan tradition</b> <strike> The United Methodist Church and its predecessor denominations</strike>&nbsp;have a long history of witness for justice in the economic order. John Wesley and early Methodists, for <strike> instance</strike>&nbsp; <b>example</b>, were <strike> staunchly</strike>&nbsp; <b>firmly</b> opposed to the slave trade, to smuggling, and to <b>what we today call</b> conspicuous consumption. <b>Beginning in 1908,</b> <b>s</b><strike> S</strike> ocial creeds adopted by our predecessor churches<strike> ,<b> </b>beginning in 1908,</strike>&nbsp;stressed social justice in the economic world, with special attention to <strike> the exploitation of </strike> child labor and inhumanely long working hours.<br /> <b> </b>Throughout <strike> this</strike>&nbsp; <b>the 20</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;and into the 21</sub><sup>st</sup></sub></b> century<b>, the</b> <strike> our c<b></strike> C</b>hurch has promoted decent working conditions and the right to organize and bargain collectively, and it has opposed discrimination in the workplace on the basis of race, ethnic background, gender, age, or disability. Historically our tradition has opposed church investments in companies manufacturing liquor or tobacco products or promoting gambling. <br /> Since the 1960s, our denomination and its predecessors have built a solid record <strike> expressing our ethics in our investment decisions</strike>&nbsp; <b>based on our belief that every financial investment has ethical dimensions with consequences that are both fiscal and social.</b> United Methodist agencies and conferences fought against the manufacture of napalm and were involved in the social-justice issues raised by religious shareholders. In the mid-1970s, the General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) <b>issued </b><strike> began</strike>&nbsp;official social responsibility guidelines for general <strike> c<b></strike> C</b>hurch investments. <br /> <strike> While the issue of economic sanction against</strike>&nbsp; <b>Historically,</b> apartheid in South Africa <strike> engaged us more than any other,</strike>&nbsp; <b>was the major issue for many church-related investors, but </b>United Methodist agencies, affiliated institutions, conferences, congregations, and individual members have brought the <strike> c<b></strike> C</b>hurch's Christian witness to business on numerous issues, including employment discrimination, environmental preservation, militarism, nuclear weapons production, reevaluation of infant formula use and the HIV/AIDS pandemic. The <strike> c<b></strike> C</b>hurch also continues to advocate on such issues as: <br /> <br /></li></li><li>international fair labor practice; <br /></li></li></li><li>domestic and global human rights; <br /> <ul><li>lending practices or policies for lesser developed communities and nations; <br /> <strike></li></li></li><li>and issues of</strike>&nbsp;violence to persons; </li></li><br /><li>firearms sales<strike> ,</strike>&nbsp; <b>and</b> gun policies; </li></li><br /><li>best corporate governance practices; <strike> unethical corporate practices,</strike> </li></li><br /><li>environmental reporting; <br /> <strike></li></li></li><li>public disclosure on financial</strike>&nbsp;risks of global warming and climate change; </li></li><br /><li>genetically modified organisms; and </li></li><br /><li>food safety. <br /> </li></li></li></li></li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We affirm that all financial resources of the church and its members are God-given resources, to be held in trust for use or investment in ways that promote the reign of God on earth. <br /> Further, we recognize that every investment has ethical dimensions. Financial investments have consequences that are both fiscal and social. We believe social justice and social usefulness must be given consideration together with financial security and financial yield in the investment of funds by United Methodist Church agencies and affiliated institutions, and by congregations as well as individual United Methodists. Socially responsible investing by Christian institutions and individuals must take account of both sets of considerations. <br /> <b></strike> Socially Responsible Investing Strategies <br /> </b><strike> Our c<b></strike> The C</b>hurch's witness through investments <b>takes</b> <strike> has taken</strike>&nbsp;four forms, each of which may be employed with the others. They are: <br /> <b>1. Portfolio screening <br /> Because some companies and enterprises, such as those manufacturing alcoholic beverages and tobacco-related products and manufacturing, selling or distributing pornography and gambling opportunities, violate basic church teaching, they are excluded from investment. In addition, many church investors refuse to invest in major military contractors or companies with nuclear weapons contracts. Historically, many investors refused to invest in companies doing business in South Africa during the apartheid era. In some cases, they divested of such companies, making public their action as a moral statement. <br /> </b><strike> 1. Avoidance by Divestment. This policy prohibits investment in enterprises that have policies or practices that are so morally reprehensible that investment in these companies is not tolerated by the church. Our denomination traditionally has avoided investments in liquor, tobacco, and gambling. Historically many church investors have refused to invest in major military contractors, companies with nuclear weapons contracts, or companies when they were doing business in South Africa under apartheid. In some cases, they have divested of such companies, making public their action as a moral statement. <br /> <b></strike> 2. Social Impact Investing <br /> The members of The United Methodist Church expect all Church-related investments to make a positive contribution toward the goals outlined in the Social Principles and <i>The Book of Resolutions</i>. Investment strategy, therefore, is based on careful consideration of not only financial returns, but also of social returns across a wide range of issues and concerns. Some investments, however, are undertaken to achieve very specific social outcomes, such as the construction of affordable housing, the renewal of a particular neighborhood or the expansion of business ownership among those traditionally excluded from such ownership. <br /> </b><strike> 2. Affirmative Choice. This strategy is to choose intentionally enterprises for investment based on careful consideration of return, both in social values and in social justice, as well as financial security and monetary profit. For United Methodist investors, the Social Principles and The Book of Resolutions delineate the social goals to which we expect all our investments to make a positive contribution. But with certain affirmative investments we may seek a very specific social outcome, such as the construction of affordable housing, the renewal of a particular neighborhood, or the expansion of business ownership to those traditionally excluded. <br /> <b></strike> 3. Shareholder Advocacy <br /> Companies may meet the broad investing guidelines of the Church but still fall short of the standards expressed in the Social Principles and <i>The Book of Resolutions</i>. Responsible Christian investing includes seeking to change company policies and practices to match more closely articulated Church values. As shareholders of corporations, Church investors may engage corporate management in a variety of ways &ndash; from gentle persuasion to public pressure, from dialogue to voting proxies, from filing shareholder resolutions to building coalitions. In many cases, such advocacy has resulted in important policy changes at the corporate level. <br /> </b><strike> 3. Shareholder Advocacy. The practices of corporations in which the church invests may fall short of the moral standards expressed in the Social Principles and The Book of Resolutions. Responsible Christian investing includes seeking to change company policies and practices for the better. Church investors have, as shareholders of corporations, engaged corporate management in a great variety of ways&mdash;from gentle persuasion to public pressure, from dialogue to voting proxies to filing shareholder resolutions, and building coalitions. In many cases, corporate policies have changed as a result. <br /> <b></strike> 4. Strategic Partnerships <br /> Working in collaboration with others strengthens the socially responsible witness and allows the synergy of strategies more forcefully to engage corporations on issues of governance, and environmental and social importance. Strategic partners may include United Methodist boards, agencies, foundations and universities, other faith-based investors, domestic and global non-governmental organizations and other concerned socially responsible investors. <br /> </b><strike> 4. Strategic Partnerships. This is the practice of working in collaboration with others to utilize synergy of strategies and resources to engage corporations on issues of governance, environmental and social importance. Such partnerships may include: United Methodist boards, agencies, foundations, universities, concerned socially responsible investors, domestic and global faith-based and non-governmental organizations. <br /> <b></strike> Investment </b>Policy<b> </b><strike> and Implementation of Policy<b></strike> <br /> </b>The policy goals of the General Conference of The United Methodist Church, its general agencies, and <b>the</b> entities under its control shall be: <br /> 1. to invest <strike> as much as possible in entities</strike>&nbsp;
