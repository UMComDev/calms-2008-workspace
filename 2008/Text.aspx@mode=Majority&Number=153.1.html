Cost for this study will be borne by the Episcopal Fund and the General Administration Fund. <b>All proposals</b> <strike> It</strike>&nbsp;should be guided by the following principles:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>A. Basic Guidelines&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b>&nbsp; 1. &ldquo;The mission of the Church is to make disciples of Jesus Christ;&rdquo; Matthew 28:19 further clarifies that this mission is to &ldquo;all nations.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Methodist Church must find a way to better organize itself for this global mission. <br /> 2. The unity of the United Methodist Church is a gift given by God; any proposed restructuring changes of the United Methodist Church must ensure that the church is united by our mission, our doctrine, and our discipline. <br /> 3. In order for the Church to be effective in diverse locales, some freedom to vary within the Church must be given to Regional Conferences as long as it is not contrary to the mission, doctrine, or basic discipline of the United Methodist Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, some Regional Conferences must be given the right to ordain persons without the educational criteria required in the United States. <br /> 4. The United States portion of the United Methodist Church needs the &ldquo;central conferences&rdquo; as much as the &ldquo;central conferences&rdquo; need the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Methodist Church must continually be conscious of matters of equity in the church.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> 5. Since representation is a key issue across the church, the Study Committee will give that increased attention. <br /> 6. Because of our respect for other churches of the Wesleyan tradition, special attention will be given to the impact of proposed changes in our relationship with member churches of the World Methodist Church. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>B </b><strike> A</strike> . <b>Scheduling Guidelines</b> <strike> General Conference and US Regional Conference</strike>&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The General Conference would meet for one week with the same number of delegates as currently elected apportioned in the same way as now done.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Following the meeting of the General Conference, the US delegates to General Conference would meet as the US Regional Conference to conduct its business.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; General Conference will always meet prior to any and all Regional Conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While this arrangement could continue indefinitely, each body could decide to meet at a separate time and place. However, for reasons of cost and the long-range plans already made for General Conferences in the near future, it is envisioned that back-to-back meetings will be held in the United States for the first two quadrennia after passage.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>C</b> <strike> B</strike> . Powers of the General Conference&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Essentially, the power of the General Conference will remain the same. <b>As stated in ¶ 16, the General Conference will be in charge of &ldquo;all matters distinctly connectional.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;In those places where the discipline is overly complex and not easily divided, this petition submits guidelines to direct the work of the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, </b>it will have authority over the following: <br /> <b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.
