Isaiah 58:12); and <br /> WHEREAS, because of the continuing threat of violence to Israeli communities and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> individuals from militant Palestinian factions whose desire is to violate borders, and cause death, terror and destruction to Israeli citizens, Israel has the right to defend her people and to try to keep these militant enemies out of her territory by building a retaining wall to protect her communities; and <br /> WHEREAS, the scripture says that &ldquo;He who touches (Israel) touches the apple of His eye&rdquo;; and <br /> WHEREAS, the pull-out of the Gaza settlers in 2005 proved the point, that this kind of action caused intense and dehumanizing suffering for those Jewish settlers who were commanded to leave their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also brought about home demolitions, uprooted graveyards, bulldozed buildings and confiscation of property that had been owned for years by these Jewish settlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has caused many of these people to be displaced, many of them still without permanent residences.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is still hopelessness and frustration, as the issues surrounding this uprooting have yet to be resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp;It also gives hard evidence to the fact that terrorist organizations want to occupy the land that the Israelis have left; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, since the Israelis have left Gaza, the Palestinians in Gaza have continued to suffer in increasing ways, and Palestinian militants have used this territory to launch over 2000 rockets into Israel on a regular basis, along with rearming with weapons that can cause more extensive suffering and death to Israeli citizens outside Gaza.&nbsp;&nbsp;The willingness of the Israeli government to pull out of Gaza has not resulted in any good among the Palestinians because the agenda of these militants to destroy Israel has not changed; and <br /> WHEREAS, Israel, having no one to defend her, must defend herself, and is then blamed for every action of defense, and also realizing that as Israel has support from other countries, the terrorists may not be so likely to strike, since this presents a more united front from Israel and the nations that support her; and <br /> WHEREAS, the United States has, at least outwardly, stood with Israel through their taxes, and several billion dollars in economic and military assistance to the State of Israel each year, we have enjoyed a measure of protection from the hand of God, who said, "I will bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you." (Gen. 12:3) However, if we discontinue helping Israel, then God's gracious hand of mercy may be removed; and <br /> WHEREAS, the US government has given billions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority which has not been used to improve the conditions of it&rsquo;s people but instead has been used on weapons and for the private bank accounts of Palestinian government officials and others they work with; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, the church has affirmed Israel&rsquo;s right to exist within secure borders, it is well-known that Israel's enemies have openly declared that they would like to see Israel "wiped off the map", and that from the very beginning of Israel's sovereignty in the land, Arab leaders, declaring a jihad or holy war, publicly vowed, "We are going to kill all Jews or drive them into the sea"; <br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that The United Methodist Church supports the continued military control of Judea and Samaria, and all that was gained as a result of the six-day war in 1967, until such time that it is well-understood that the land rightfully belongs to Israel and, and there is safety for Israeli and Palestinian peoples from the untold violence of militant Islamic factions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we are people of the Bible, we support the biblical vision of a "Greater Israel", including all disputed territories and the whole of Jerusalem and its surroundings. <br /> Be it further resolved, that we urge the U.S. government to continue to give military aid to the region, and to support non-governmental organizations throughout the region, including religious institutions, and other organizations who are supporting Israel and the return of the Jewish people back to the land, and also blessing, helping and encouraging groups within the communities of other nationalities within the region; The United Methodist Church requests that the government of the United States, acting according to the biblical mandate to love, pray for and bless the nation of Israel, urge Israel to: <br /> act in humility and fairness toward those of other nationalities living within the land, not denying them of their needs as fellow human beings; <br /> continue building and expanding existing settlements, knowing that they have a biblical right to do this, including the whole of Jerusalem; <br /> continue governing as they see fit, and not withdrawing Israeli military forces, particularly holding onto all territory that was regained since 1948;&nbsp;&nbsp;hold on to the segment of the Wall of Separation that has been constructed since May 2002 until such time that it is accepted that Israel has the right to control that territory; <br /> We also urge the Palestinian Authority and all Palestinian Religious Leaders to continue to publicly condemn violence against Israeli civilians, and to not resist Israel&rsquo;s ownership of all Israeli settlements; <br /> We urge all United Methodists in the U.S. to: <br /> advocate with the U.S. Administration and Congress to implement the above steps; <br /> encourage members of each congregation to study the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from a biblical perspective by studying the Word of God, inviting speakers to church events, reading books, using audio visual resources in educational forums, and getting information from websites, as long as it lines up with what the bible has to say on this subject; <br /> provide financial support to the Israeli and the Palestinian people through contributions to the General Board of Global Ministries; <br /> support, and participate in, the work of groups and organizations that are operating under the mandate of God when it comes to blessing Israel; <br /> reach out to local synagogues and other faith groups by finding ways to bless them and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> when appropriate, doing identificational repentance for atrocities done during the holocaust to the Jewish people and other people groups at other times in history, believing that by doing this, history will not be able to repeat itself; <br /> and we also ask that the General Board of Global Ministries, working together with the General Board of Church & Society and other organizations, develop informational packets for use in local congregations to promote the return to the land, and to promote a just and lasting peace and human rights for all in the region. <br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>I am a United Methodist of 20 years, who never knew the Resolution book existed until recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;In it, I discovered something that ripped at my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current Resolution number 312 is completely against Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote this because we are called to bless Israel.&nbsp;&nbsp;(Gen. 12:3.) <br /> <br /></p></td>
