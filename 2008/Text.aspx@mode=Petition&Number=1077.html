Call upon local, state and federal educational agencies to annually and publicly report the retention rate for students entering 9</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>, 10</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>, 11</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;and 12</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;grades by sex, race and ethnicity; <br /> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp; Call upon local, state and federal educational agencies to make increasing the percentage of entering 9</sub><sup>th</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;grade students who graduate on time with a high school diploma a major focus of educational reform; <br /> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp; Call upon local, state and federal educational agencies to make such changes as needed in accountability systems to provide incentives for schools to keep their most challenged students in school &mdash; such as smaller class size, support for teachers&rsquo; professional development, and opportunities for students to recover from failure; <br /> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Call for equitable distribution of financial and other educational resources to all school districts so that no school district will be at a disadvantage in striving to provide quality education for all children within its boundaries;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recommend that in each annual conference concerned United Methodists ask their state and federal legislators to support legislation that will help implement concerns 1-5 above; <br /> </CENTER> 7.&nbsp;&nbsp; Request that the General Board of Church and Society develop and promote an educational program to help equip United Methodists to advocate on the above issues.</b><br /></p></td>
