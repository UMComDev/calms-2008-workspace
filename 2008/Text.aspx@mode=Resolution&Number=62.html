<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>62. Support Reparations for African Americans <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, the General Conference acknowledges and profoundly regrets the massive human suffering and the tragic plight of millions of men, women, and children caused by slavery and the transatlantic slave trade; and <br> Whereas, at the conclusion of the Civil War, the plan for the economic redistribution of land and resources on behalf of the former slaves of the Confederacy was never enacted; and <br> Whereas, the failure to distribute land prevented newly freed Blacks from achieving true autonomy and made their civil and political rights all but meaningless; and <br> Whereas, conditions comparable to &ldquo;economic depression&rdquo; continue for millions of African Americans in communities where unemployment often exceeds 50 percent; and <br> Whereas, justice requires that African American descendants of the transatlantic slave trade be assured of having access to effective and appropriate protection and remedies, including the right to seek just and adequate reparation or satisfaction for the legacy of damages, consequent structures of racism and racial discrimination suffered as a result of the slave trade; and <br> Whereas, Isaiah 61:1-3 provides a model for reparations:&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives, . . . to proclaim the year of the Lord&rsquo;s favor,... and provide for those who grieve in Zion-to bestow on them a crown of beauty instead of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, and a garment of praise instead of a spirit of despair.&rdquo;; and, <br> Whereas, January 5, 1993, Congressman John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) introduced H.R. 40 to the House of Representatives, calling for the establishment of the Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans, &ldquo;acknowledging the fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality and inhumanity of slavery in the United States from 1619 to the present day,&rdquo; for the purpose of submitting a report to Congress for further action and consideration with respect to slavery&rsquo;s effects on African American lives, economics, and politics; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved:</i><br> 1. that we support the discussion and study of reparation for African Americans; <br> 2. that we petition the President, the Vice President, and the United States House of Representatives to support the passage and signing of H.R. 40; <br> 3. that a written copy of this petition be delivered to the President and Vice President of the United States, the United States Senate Majority Leader, the House Speaker, and House Member John Conyers Jr. <br> 4. that the General Commission on Religion and Race and the General Board of Church and Society develop a strategy for interpretation and support of passage of H.R. 40;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 5. That the appropriate general boards and agencies of The United Methodist Church develop and make available to its members data on the history of slavery and the role of theology in validating and supporting both the institution and the abolition of the slave trade; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 6. That we call upon The United Methodist Church to acknowledge the memory of the victims of past tragedies and affirm that, wherever and whenever these tragedies occur, they must be condemned and their recurrence prevented <br> <p align="right"><b>adopted 1996<br> amended and Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
