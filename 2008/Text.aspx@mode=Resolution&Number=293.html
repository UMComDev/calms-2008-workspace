Oppose Food and Medicine Blockades or Embargoes <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, as Christians we have a moral obligation to support life and stand against any force or action that causes suffering and death; and <br> Whereas, some groups of nations, governments, and /or factions within a country have stopped the flow and free marketing of food and medicines, seeking political gains; and <br> Whereas, such practices cause pain and suffering, malnutrition, or starvation with all its detrimental consequences to the innocent civilian population, especially the children; and <br> Whereas, the blockade of food and medicines is used many times to force riots in the general population, putting them in greater danger; and <br> Whereas, the media have brought to us the terrible images of children and women suffering, sick, and starving due to the blockade of food and medicines in recent conflicts; <br> <i>Therefore,</i> <i>be it resolved,</i> that as United Methodists, we request the United Nations to declare the practice of impeding the flow or free commerce of food and medicines to be a crime against humanity; and, as such, not to be permitted in or by the Security Council; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that as United Methodists, we request the President of the United States and the United States Congress to abstain from using embargoes or blockades of food and medicines, with no exceptions, as an instrument of foreign policy; <br> And we, as Christians, call upon world leaders to affirm life, to affirm and guarantee the right of all human beings to have access to food and adequate health care, regardless of their political or ideological views. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> AMENDED AND READOPTED 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 165<i>B</i> and <i>C.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
