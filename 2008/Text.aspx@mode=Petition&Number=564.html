By His example, we are called to give children special attention enabling them to be free from harm. (Matthew 19:13-15, NRSV) Alarming statistics make it clear that the United States and many other countries have not given the proper attention to the use of alcohol and other drugs by children and youth and that as a society, we tolerate access to alcohol and other drugs by underage young people. For example, it is illegal in most U.S. states to sell or give alcoholic beverages to those under 21, and illicit use and sale of "controlled substances&rdquo; is a crime at any age, yet<strike> , </b>Whereas over<b></strike> more than</b> a third of children begin using alcohol before they are teens<strike> ;</strike>&nbsp;and<strike>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whereas,</strike>&nbsp;one in ten young teens is a regular user of marijuana and other drugs<strike> ; and Whereas<b></strike> . Research shows that alcohol and other drugs bring harm to growing bodies and minds.

However, </b>the Justice Department reports that many school programs aimed to help young people have not deterred their use of alcohol and other drugs<b>.</b><strike> ; and Whereas, young people with inner stamina, self-esteem, and faith more readily can say,&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;no&rdquo; to drugs and alcohol;<b></strike>&nbsp;Inattention to this critical issue and the failure of many school programs demonstrates the importance of a comprehensive action plan among faith communities to address this crisis. <br /> </b>Therefore, be it resolved, that <strike> we, the 2000 General Conference of </strike> The United Methodist Church, support<b>s</b> efforts to keep children<b> and youth alcohol free, </b>drug free<b>,</b> and safe <b>from access to illicit drug use.
