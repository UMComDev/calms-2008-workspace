<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>308. Global Economy and the Environment <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The United Methodist Church has been rightly concerned about the environment and its sustainability, given the rapid depletion of natural resources and the contamination of the air, water, and land. However, we have been slow to recognize the impact of the emerging global economy and its impact upon the environment. <br> When the economic institutions were contained within the boundaries of countries, governments had the power to regulate. Particularly, in the area of the environment, communities could exercise control so that pollution and waste could be regulated and conservation encouraged. Of course, this adds costs to doing business. However, if everyone is under the same constraints, no one is at a disadvantage. <br> &nbsp; As countries rush to open up markets in the name of free trade, it is obvious that those countries that have strict environmental regulations are going to be at a competitive disadvantage in attracting and keeping business. Business will seek countries in which to operate that have lower environmental standards and, therefore, lower operating costs. Pressures will increase on countries with higher standards to lower them, and developing countries will be hesitant to enact environmental legislation. <br> <i>The United Methodist Church therefore recommends: <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>1. that every country, including the United States, require that there be roughly equivalent environmental standards between itself and any other country with which it enters into a free-trade agreement, so that there is not a competitive disadvantage for the country with the stricter standards. Mechanisms should also be included in the agreement that will allow for further new standards of environmental regulations in the future; <br> 2. that the General Board of Church and Society develop a statement outlining the relationship of the world economy to the environment and communicate this to appropriate governmental agencies and the church; <br> 3. that the General Board of Church and Society develop study materials for local congregations; and <br> 4. that local congregations study the implications of the global economy on the environment. Study materials might include: <i>For the Common Good: Redirecting the Economy</i> <i>Toward Community</i>, <i>The Environment, and a Sustainable Future, </i>by Herman E. Daly and John B. Cobb; <i>Sustaining the Common Good, A Christian Perspective on the Global Economy</i>; or materials to be developed by the General Board of Church and Society. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1996<br> Readopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶165<i>B</i> and <i>D.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
