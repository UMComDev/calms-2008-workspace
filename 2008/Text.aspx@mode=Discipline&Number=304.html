<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>304.</b> <i>Qualifications for Ordination</i>-1. Those whom the Church ordains shall be conscious of God&rsquo;s call to ordained ministry, and their call shall be acknowledged and authenticated by the Church. God&rsquo;s call has many manifestations, and the Church cannot structure a single test of authenticity. Nevertheless, the experience of the Church and the needs of its ministry require certain qualities of faith, life, and practice from those who seek ordination as deacons and elders. In order that The United Methodist Church may be assured that those persons who present themselves as candidates for ordained ministry are truly called of God, the Church expects persons seeking ordination to: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> Have a personal faith in Christ and be committed to Christ as Savior and Lord. <br> <i>b)</i> Nurture and cultivate spiritual disciplines and patterns of holiness. <br> <i>c)</i> Acknowledge a call by God to give themselves completely to ordained ministry following Jesus&rsquo; pattern of love and service. <br> <i>d)</i> Communicate persuasively the Christian faith in both oral and written form. <br> <i>e)</i> Make a commitment to lead the whole Church in loving service to humankind. <br> <i>f)</i> Give evidence of God&rsquo;s gifts for ordained ministry, evidence of God&rsquo;s grace in their lives, and promise of future usefulness in the mission of the Church. <br> <i>g)</i> Be persons in whom the community can place trust and confidence. <br> <i>h)</i> Accept that Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation through faith in God through Jesus Christ; be competent in the disciplines of Scripture, theology, church history, and Church polity; possess the skills essential to the practice of ordained ministry; and lead in making disciples for Jesus Christ. <br> <i>i)</i> Be accountable to The United Methodist Church, accept its Doctrinal Standards and <i>Discipline</i> and authority, accept the supervision of those appointed to this ministry, and be prepared to live in the covenant of its ordained ministers. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. For the sake of the mission of Jesus Christ in the world and the most effective witness to the Christian gospel, and in consideration of the influence of an ordained minister on the lives of other persons both within and outside the Church, the Church expects those who seek ordination to make a complete dedication of themselves to the highest ideals of the Christian life. To this end, they agree to exercise responsible self-control by personal habits conducive to bodily health, mental and emotional maturity, integrity in all personal relationships, fidelity in marriage and celibacy in singleness, social responsibility, and growth in grace and in the knowledge and love of God. <br> 3. While persons set apart by the Church for ordained ministry are subject to all the frailties of the human condition and the pressures of society, they are required to maintain the highest standards of holy living in the world. The practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching. Therefore self-avowed practicing homosexuals</sub><sup>1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;are not to be certified as candidates, ordained as ministers, or appointed to serve in The United Methodist Church.</sub><sup>2 <br> </sup></sub>4. The United Methodist Church entrusts those persons who are in the ordained ministry with primary responsibility for maintaining standards of education and preparation for ordination. Having been originally recommended by a charge conference and by authorization of the ordained members in full connection with the annual conference, according to the procedures set out in the <i>Book of Discipline</i> for the examination and approval of candidates for ordination, persons are elected to membership in the annual conference and ordained by the bishop. <br> 5. In all cases where the district committee on ordained ministry, conference boards of ordained ministry, or ordained members in full connection in clergy session vote on granting any status regarding license, ordination, or conference membership, it is understood that the requirements set forth herein are minimum requirements only. Each person voting is expected to vote prayerfully based on personal judgment of the applicant&rsquo;s gifts, evidence of God&rsquo;s grace, and promise of future usefulness for the mission of the Church. <br> 1. <i>&ldquo;Self-avowed practicing homosexual&rdquo;</i> is understood to mean that a person openly acknowledges to a bishop, district superintendent, district committee of ordained ministry, board of ordained ministry, or clergy session that the person is a practicing homosexual. See Judicial Council Decisions 702, 708, 722, 725, 764, 844, 984. <br> 2. <i>See</i> Judicial Council&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisions 984, 985. <br>
