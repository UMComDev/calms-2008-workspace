An individual requesting to become a member must be willing to answer &ldquo;yes&rdquo; to all four questions contained in the United Methodist Hymnal on Page 34. If the potential member is not willing to answer yes to the first question regarding repenting of their sin and if the individual is not willing to receive counseling from the Pastor or other qualified professional counselor, then the Pastor shall have the responsibility and authority to decide that this individual cannot become a member of the United Methodist Church. If after completion of counseling the individual is willing to agree to repent of their sin and ask for forgiveness and answer yes to all the questions on Page 34 of the UM Hymnal, then the Pastor can determine the individual is qualified to become a member of the United Methodist Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>An individual requesting to become a member of the United Methodist Church must make a commitment to repent of their sin(s). The scriptures clearly state numerous sins such as stealing, lying, murder, homosexuality, etc. God did not give us authority in the BIBLE to ignore any scripture regarding sin. <br /> <br /></p></td>
