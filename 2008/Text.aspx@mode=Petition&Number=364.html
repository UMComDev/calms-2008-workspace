This trust requirement is an essential element of the historic polity of The United Methodist Church or its predecessor denominations or communions and has been a part of the <i>Discipline</i> since 1797. It reflects the connectional structure of the Church by ensuring that the property will be used solely for purposes consonant with the mission of the entire denomination as set forth in the <i>Discipline</i>. The trust requirement is thus a fundamental expression of United Methodism whereby local churches and other agencies and institutions within the denomination are both held accountable to and benefit from their connection with the entire worldwide Church. <br /> </b>In consonance with the legal definition and self-understanding of The United Methodist Church (see ¶ 139), and with particular reference to its lack of capacity to hold title to property, The United Methodist Church is organized as a connectional structure, and titles to all real and personal, tangible and intangible property held at jurisdictional, annual, or district conference levels, or by a local church or charge, or by an agency or institution of the Church, shall be held in trust for The United Methodist Church and subject to the provisions of its <i>Discipline</i>. Titles are not held by The United Methodist Church (See ¶ 807.1) or by the General Conference of The United Methodist Church, but instead by the incorporated conferences, agencies, or organizations of the denomination, or in the case of unincorporated bodies of the denomination, by boards of trustees established for the purpose of holding and administering real and personal, tangible and intangible property. <br /> <b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;The trust is and always has been irrevocable, except as provided in the Discipline.&nbsp;&nbsp;Property can be released from the trust, transferred free of trust or subordinated to the interests of creditors and other third parties only to the extent authority is given by the Discipline<i>.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Local churches and other United Methodist agencies and institutions may acquire, hold, maintain, improve, and sell property for purposes consistent with the mission of the Church, unless restricted or prevented by the Discipline.</b><br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>These changes clarify the nature of the trust clause as it relates to corporate law and amplify the historic and basic nature of the trust clause to our identity as a connectional church.<br /></p></td>
