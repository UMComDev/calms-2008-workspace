The Connectional Table<b> </b>shall be authorized to approve allocations to the general program agencies for additional program funding up to the limit so established. No money shall be allocated by the Connectional Table from this source for general administrative costs, fixed charges, or capital outlay without approval by the General Council on Finance and Administration. <br> (6) The Connectional Table shall receive from the General Council on Finance and Administration copies of the proposed annual budgets of the general program agencies, in order that it may review such budgets in relation to the program proposals made by those agencies in their quadrennial budget requests. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c)</i> It shall recommend the formulas by which all apportionments to the annual conferences shall be determined, subject to the approval of the General Conference. <br> <i>d)</i> In the case of the Ministerial Education Fund, Black College Fund, Africa University Fund, and Interdenominational Cooperation Fund, the General Council on Finance and Administration and the Connectional Table shall proceed in the following manner to develop funding level recommendations. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) The Connectional Table shall, in consultation with the General Council on Finance and Administration, develop funding level recommendations to the General Council on Finance and Administration for these funds. <br> (2) The General Council on Finance and Administration shall then establish the estimated amount available for distribution through those funds. <br> (3) The Connectional Table, in consultation with the General Council on Finance and Administration, will review both the funding priorities and the estimated amount available to the funds and then establish the amounts to be distributed to each. <br> (4) Only when the General Council on Finance and Administration and the Connectional Table agree on the funding levels for each fund will these be recommended to the General Conference by the General Council on Finance and Administration. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;2. It shall receive and disburse in accordance with budgets and/or directives approved by the General Conference all funds raised throughout the Church for any of the general funds of the Church, as listed or defined in ¶&nbsp;810.1, and for any other fund or funds, as directed by the proper authority. <br> 3. <i>Accounting and Reporting</i>-It shall require all agencies receiving general Church funds (<i>see</i> ¶&nbsp;810.2) to follow uniform accounting classifications and procedures for reporting.
