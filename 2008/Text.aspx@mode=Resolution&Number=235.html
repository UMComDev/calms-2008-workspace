<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>235. Rights of African American Farmers <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The 1996 Social Principles state, &ldquo;We support the right of persons and families to live and prosper as farmers . . .&rdquo;Unfortunately, this has not been the reality for African American farmers. Since the landmark 1982 Civil Rights Commission report the situation facing Black farmers remains dismal. That report found that the United States Department of Agriculture had not placed adequate emphasis on dealing with the crisis facing black farmers and that if the current rate of land loss continues there will not be any Black farmers left by the year 2000. <br> A November 1990 Report of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Government Operations confirms that conditions have not improved. The report states, &ldquo;By 1978 the rate of loss for blacks increased to 57.3 percent, 2 and 1/2 times the rate of loss for whites. Between census years 1982 and 1987, the number of black operated farms declined 30.9 percent compared with 6.6 percent for white operated farms. A 1992 U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of Census of Agriculture found that between 1920 and 1978, the number of white-operated farms declined 63 percent in the United States. Between 1920 and 1992, the number of Black farmers in the United States declined from 925,710 to 18,816, or by 98 percent. Presently, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Black farmers now own less than 1 percent of the farmland in the United States; at the turn of the 20th century that figure was 14 percent. In 1920 nearly 1 million Black farmers tilled American soil; 70 years later, that number had dropped to fewer than 20,000. <br> The continuing loss of ownership and control of agricultural land by African American farmers has reduced their ability to achieve economic viability and financial independence. This loss has been accelerated by the Black landowners&rsquo; lack of access to capital, technical information, and legal resources needed to train and develop agricultural land holdings into stable, income-producing, self-sustaining operations. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the institution designed to help all farmers, practiced widespread discrimination. These discriminatory practices have cost Black farmers loan approval, loan servicing, and farm management assistance. Many Black farmers never learned of the many support services available to them, including low-interest rates for socially disadvantaged farmers. Black farmers in financial distress often do not receive reliable and comprehensive advice from USDA officials in time to prevent foreclosure. Many times Black farmers who go to apply for various conservation and credit programs are told that applications are not available for another several weeks. When they return, they are then told that all resources are committed. A 1997 USDA Civil Rights Report has confirmed these practices. <br> In 1999, USDA reached a settlement of a class action suit by African American farmers who have experienced discrimination. The Agriculture Department will provide $50,000 in cash settlement plus debt forgiveness to qualified Black farmers who were denied government loans and other assistance because of their race. Farmers who have strong documentation of their case may receive more than the $50,000. Unfortunately, for many Black farmers the settlement is too little, too late. Many have lost their land and opportunities to prosper in the vocation of their choice. The United Methodist Church takes seriously Paul&rsquo;s advice: &ldquo;If one member suffers, all suffer together.&rdquo; Thus, the General Conference: <br> 1. condemns the discriminatory policies against African American farmers by the private lenders and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA); <br> 2. strongly supports the crucial need for the church, the government and the private sector to provide financial, technical, and management assistance to help stop the decline of Black-owned farmland in America; <br> 3. applauds the settlement of the class action suit by Black farmers against USDA; <br> 4. calls on USDA to put into place stringent regulations to guard against discrimination; to fully implement, without delay, the recommendations of the 1997 USDA Civil Rights Report and the National Commission on Small Farms Report; and to include Black and other minority farmers on county committees that oversee USDA loan and other programs; <br> 5. calls on the U.S. Congress to fully fund the Minority Farm Outreach and Technical Assistance Program; and <br> 6. calls on the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Global Ministries to work with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund and other community-based organizations to address the needs of Black farmers and to improve access to USDA programs. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>A </i>and<i> H. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
