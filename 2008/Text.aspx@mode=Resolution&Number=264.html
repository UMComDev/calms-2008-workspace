<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>IMMIGRATION <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER>264. Assistance, Sanctuary, and Deportation Relief for Central American, Caribbean, Salvadorean, and Other Refugees <br> </CENTER>&nbsp; </b>As Christians we are called by God to show compassion for refugees. The Bible directs us to care for the &ldquo;foreigners&rdquo; in our midst (Exodus 23:9, King James Version) and reminds us that we too are &ldquo;sojourners&rdquo; (Leviticus 25:23, Revised Standard Version). Jesus and his family had to flee to Egypt to escape persecution (Matthew 2:13-15). We are told in Hebrews 13:2 (RSV), &ldquo;Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.&rdquo;<br> According to the terms of the Refugee Act of 1980, the United States accords refugee or asylum status to persons who cannot return to their countries of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution, for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Refugees from Central America and other areas of Latin America and the Caribbean are fleeing to the United States to escape the persecution, torture, and murder of their civil-war-torn homelands. Many of these refugees have been tortured and murdered when forced to return to their homelands. <br> <i>We call upon The United Methodist Church to: <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>1. strongly oppose the deportation of Central American, Caribbean, Salvadorean, and other refugees from the United States; and call on the President of the United States, the United States attorney general, the Department of State, and the Congress to grant &ldquo;permanent resident&rdquo; legal status to Central American, Caribbean, Salvadorean, and other refugees; <br> 2. request that annual conferences and local churches assist in ministries to Central American, Caribbean, Salvadorean, African, and other refugees by providing them with legal assistance, bail bond funds, food, housing, and medical care; <br> 3. encourage congregations to resist the policy of the Immigration and Naturalization Service by declaring their churches as &ldquo;sanctuaries&rdquo; for refugees from El Salvador, Guatemala, and other areas of the Caribbean and Latin America; and <br> 4. urge the United States government to follow the United Nations definition of refugees. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1984 <br> REVISED AND ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 164<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
