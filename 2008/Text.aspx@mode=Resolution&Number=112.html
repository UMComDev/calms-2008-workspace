<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>112. United Methodist Response to Hospital Mergers <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, a crisis in health care is occurring in communities across the United States because of the ever-increasing number of hospital mergers, and <br> Whereas, such mergers often put the availability of AIDS prevention information, fertility services, artificial insemination, tubal ligations, vasectomies, condom distribution, contraceptive medication and devices, &ldquo;morning after&rdquo; pills, and abortion services at risk; and <br> Whereas, such mergers can result in the denial of certain types of end-of-life health care; and <br> Whereas, the effect of these mergers is most severe in poorer communities that have limited health care options to begin with; and <br> Whereas, these mergers are usually completed, often with the assistance of public money, before the public is even aware they are happening or what the consequences will be; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the General Board of Church and Society and the Women&rsquo;s Division work to alert their constituencies concerning this crisis in reproductive and end-of-life health care, and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Board of Church and Society and the Women&rsquo;s Division expand their health and wholeness public policy advocacy to include this critical issue of reproductive and end-of-life health care; and <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the General Board of Church and Society and the Women&rsquo;s Division work in cooperation with appropriate community groups to make resource materials available to local churches; such materials to include briefing papers, articles, action alerts, sample sermons, and information on gaining legal intervention when necessary to deal with the crisis of increasingly limited reproductive and end-of-life health care in their communities. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>T.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
