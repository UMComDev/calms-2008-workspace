To be such a church, God <br /> needs disciples who are faithful sowers of the gospel in <br /> our world. In the parable of the seed in Mark 3:3-9, 13- <br /> 20, Jesus teaches that for there to be a harvest, there <br /> needs to be sowing. Jesus Christ calls and depends on <br /> his disciples to faithfully present the gospel wherever <br /> they find themselves and to whomsoever will respond. <br /> Sowing involves risks, including the risks of no fruit <br /> coming to maturity and of a small harvest. Some persons <br /> may not respond at all, while others may respond only <br /> partially. However, the more seed planted, the greater <br /> the chances of a harvest, a harvest that will make the <br /> effort worthwhile. Disciples sow as they minister in the <br /> world, and they depend on God for the harvest. <br /> We rejoice and are thankful for what has been <br /> accomplished through the National Plan. At the same <br /> time we realize that opportunities remain. Much more <br /> still needs to be done if The United Methodist Church is <br /> to reap the fruits of what the National Plan has been <br /> doing. The early church learned that through the <br /> empowerment of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost they were <br /> able to become an effective and powerful church, witnessing <br /> to the resurrected Jesus and thus continuing the <br /> Lord&rsquo;s ministry. Today, as disciples of Jesus Christ and <br /> as his church, we must be sensitive to the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s <br /> leading as we continue sowing and cultivating the seed <br /> so that new people may respond to the gospel. <br /> If The United Methodist Church is to grow, we <br /> must continue to reach out to the growing <br /> Hispanic/Latino population in our midst. The US <br /> Hispanic/Latino population has increased by approximately <br /> thirteen million between 1990 and 2000 or by <br /> about 58%. In six southern states (North Carolina, <br /> Arkansas, Georgia, Tennessee, South Carolina, and <br /> Alabama) and four other states (Kentucky, Minnesota, <br /> Nebraska, and Nevada), the increase in the <br /> Hispanic/Latino population ranged from 394% to 155% <br /> between 1990 and 2000. Every annual conference has a <br /> growing Hispanic/Latino population. According to the <br /> US Census Bureau&rsquo;s demographic projections, by 2011 <br /> there will be twenty-five conferences with 100,000 to <br /> 499,999 Hispanics/Latinos,1 and nineteen with over <br /> 500,000. (See Appendix for a list of the nineteen conferences.) <br /> <b>The National Plan For Hispanic/Latino Ministry <br /> 1034 DCA Advance Edition <br /> Table I: Population by Race and Ethnicity, 2005 <br /> </b>Universe: 2005 Total Native-born Foreign-born Percent <br /> Household Population population population population foreign born <br /> Hispanic 41,926,302 25,085,528 16,840,774 40.2 <br /> White alone, not Hispanic 192,526,952 185,083,309 7,443,643 3.9 <br /> Black alone, not Hispanic 34,410,656 31,875,439 2,535,217 7.4 <br /> Asian and Pacific Islander alone, not Hispanic 12,677,007 4,252,962 8,424,045 66.5 <br /> Other, not Hispanic 6,857,902 6,331,978 525,924 7.7 <br /> Total 288,398,819 252,629,216 35,769,603 12.4 <br /> <i>Source: Pew Hispanic Center tabulations of 2005 American Community Survey <br /> </i>Table I shows that in 2005, 40% of the Hispanic <br /> population in the US were immigrants. Overall, in the <br /> decades between 1970 and 2000, immigrants made up <br /> 45% of the total Hispanic population in the US, while the <br /> second generation made up 28% and the third generation <br /> made up 32%. However, because fertility rates are higher <br /> among Hispanic/Latino immigrants than in any other <br /> segment of the US population, over the next 20 years the <br /> second generation will grow to the point where they <br /> compose 36% of all Hispanics by the year 2020, while <br /> the first generation makes up 30% of the total.2 <br /> The US Census reported that the national median <br /> age of foreign-born Hispanics/Latinos was thirty-three, <br /> but for native-born Hispanics/Latinos it was eighteen. In <br /> 2000, almost 43% of Hispanic/Latino immigrants <br /> nationally had less than a high school education, but in <br /> the six above-mentioned southern states, the percentage <br /> among foreign-born Latinos was much higher&ndash;66%, <br /> compared to 31% for native-born Afro-Americans, and <br /> 20% for native-born whites in those same states. Given <br /> their recent arrival and limited education, 21% of all <br /> Hispanics/Latinos did not speak English in 2000. <br /> Although the exact number is not known, a large number <br /> of Hispanic/Latino immigrants are not legal residents, <br /> a situation that brings them and their families <br /> insecurity and constant transience, and subjects them to <br /> abuse by employers and landlords. Not surprisingly, the <br /> poverty rate of Hispanics/Latinos nationwide in 2000 <br /> was almost twice as high as that for the general population: <br /> 24.5% for Hispanics/Latinos compared to 13.3% <br /> for the overall population.3 <br /> <b><i>Accomplishments</b></i>4 <br /> <b>Signs of God&rsquo;s Faithfulness <br /> </b>Seeds are being planted; some fruits are being produced. <br /> Securing the necessary data to determine the <br /> extent of the harvest has been a continuing challenge for <br /> several important reasons. Some annual conferences do <br /> not gather the necessary data and/or do not regularly <br /> report it. Because each conference determines how and <br /> when a new congregation is chartered, Hispanic/Latino <br /> members are often not counted because the new congregations <br /> or faith communities have not yet been chartered <br /> or organized as a local church. Nevertheless, the General <br /> Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) has <br /> reported a steady increase in the Hispanic/Latino membership <br /> in our denomination over the last few years. In <br /> early 2007, the GCFA also reported that 102 new <br /> churches had been founded since 2005, and out of that <br /> number 21 of them were Hispanic.5 <br /> <b>Factors Contributing to Growth <br /> </b>Some of the following statistics from the national <br /> office&rsquo;s annual conference survey show factors that have <br /> contributed to this growth. So far this quadrennium (as <br /> of June 2007): <br /> </ul><li>Eight annual conferences received National Plan <br /> grants totaling $320,000, while in the previous <br /> quadrennium 27 conferences received grants <br /> totaling $1,261,300. <br /> </ul><li>Thirty-two annual conferences have received <br /> other kinds of resources for Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Approximately 300 church school extension programs <br /> have been developed, and 28 established <br /> Hispanic/Latino congregations in four different <br /> conferences are engaged in the Congregational <br /> Mobilization Process to renew their ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Ministry grants totaling $260,000 have been <br /> given to four different seminaries and conference <br /> centers. <br /> </ul><li>Four annual conferences are now involved in <br /> Brazilian ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Eight conferences and one seminary have held <br /> Module I, II, and III workshops in addition to <br /> three Module workshops in Portuguese. <br /> </ul><li>Seven hundred new lay missioners and pastormentors <br /> have been trained, including 90 lay persons <br /> in Brazilian ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Nineteen persons have received training to serve <br /> as facilitators of Module I and II workshops, <br /> while 50 new consultants have been prepared to <br /> assist and guide annual conferences to develop <br /> Latino ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Approximately 600 non-Hispanic/Latino church <br /> leaders participated in three jurisdictional convocations <br /> related to developing Hispanic/Latino <br /> ministries this quadrennium. <br /> </ul><li>Approximately 100 local congregations or <br /> regional groups have been involved in justice and <br /> outreach ministries. <br /> </ul><li>The General Board of Global Ministries commissioned <br /> 48 missionaries and assigned them to <br /> develop and strengthen Hispanic/Latino ministries <br /> in 22 different annual conferences. <br /> Statistics are important but do not tell the whole <br /> story. The National Plan&rsquo;s impact at the local and conference <br /> levels can been seen in the stories of clergy and <br /> laity reaching out to their communities with the gospel <br /> of Jesus Christ, serving as signs of God&rsquo;s reign among <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1035 <br /> </b>us. Hispanics/Latinos are being reached through community <br /> ministries and faith communities in non- <br /> Hispanic/Latino local churches and in Hispanic/Latino <br /> churches through the work of lay missioners and pastormentor <br /> teams and the ministry of commissioned missionaries. <br /> <b>Ypsilanti Success Stories <br /> </b>First United Methodist Church in Ypsilanti, <br /> Michigan, began reaching Latinos in its community <br /> through language programs, English and Spanish as a <br /> Second Language (ESL) classes, translation services, <br /> transportation services, referral services for undocumented <br /> persons, and mentoring programs. The church <br /> also collaborated with University of Michigan Law <br /> School students to establish a workers center. In partnership <br /> with community-based organizations, the church <br /> also provided a variety of services and cultural events for <br /> the Hispanic/Latino community and provided building <br /> space and secretarial support for a Latino theatre group. <br /> The church not only used community ministries to <br /> attract Latinos but also, through the work of a Latina lay <br /> missioner, formed a faith community. The Latina lay <br /> missioner coordinates all the church&rsquo;s ministries as a <br /> team with the senior pastor, a non-Hispanic/Latino person. <br /> The lay missioner has participated in Module I and <br /> II of the Lay Missioner and Pastor-Mentor Team <br /> Training Program. Since 2004, the faith community <br /> enabled the church to hold a worship service in Spanish <br /> every Sunday. Because of its various ministries, the <br /> church has been revitalized and has integrated its outreach <br /> program to Latinos as part of the local church&rsquo;s <br /> mission and ministry. The church now requires pastoral <br /> leadership that is bilingual in both English and Spanish <br /> to lead its ministries. <br /> <b>South Carolina Success Stories <br /> </b>The potential for growth can be seen in the South <br /> Carolina Conference where in the summer of 2006 a <br /> cluster of four non-Hispanic/Latino local churches in <br /> the area of West Columbia and Cayce joined forces to <br /> hold a vacation Bible school to reach children, the <br /> majority of them Latinos, in an apartment complex near <br /> one of the churches. These churches&rsquo; experience was the <br /> beginning of a ministry with the Hispanic/Latino community <br /> in their midst, reports the conference coordinator <br /> of Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> The experience of lay missioner and pastor-mentor <br /> teams playing a role in developing faith communities that <br /> grow to become new congregations has been repeated a <br /> number of times in the Wisconsin Conference as the <br /> National Plan has been implemented over the years. In <br /> 1995, through the work of a lay missioner and pastormentor <br /> team, faith communities were formed in different <br /> homes in the town of Delavan as part of the evangelistic <br /> outreach of a Hispanic/Latino congregation in Lake <br /> Geneva, just a few miles away. Within three years the <br /> conference recognized Delavan as a place of ministry and <br /> named a full-time local pastor to continue it. <br /> In 2000, another lay missioner from the Delavan <br /> church began faith communities in Whitewater, 15 miles <br /> from Delavan. The people from Whitewater began <br /> attending the new congregation in Delavan. Within two <br /> years the faith communities in Whitewater formed their <br /> own new congregation, which now averages 80 people <br /> in attendance at the Sunday worship service. In these <br /> two places, the lay missioner and pastor-mentor teams <br /> not only offered worship services and Bible studies to <br /> the new persons being reached, but also offered various <br /> community ministries, including translation services, <br /> and referring and taking people to medical and immigration <br /> services. The lay missioner at Whitewater is <br /> expanding the congregation&rsquo;s outreach to another <br /> nearby town, Jefferson, with some people traveling to <br /> Whitewater for worship services. <br /> More recently, through the assistance of a National <br /> Plan grant to the conference, a pastor was appointed to <br /> Green Bay to begin ministry among the growing number <br /> of Hispanics/Latinos. The pastor established a clothing <br /> and food distribution center in collaboration with a <br /> Catholic church. The pastor then formed some faith <br /> communities that have produced a worshipping congregation <br /> with an average attendance of 60 each Sunday. <br /> <b>Alabama-West Florida Success Stories <br /> </b>In the Alabama-West Florida Conference, commissioned <br /> missionaries have worked with Hispanic/Latino <br /> pastors and conference leaders to train a group of lay <br /> missioners to begin faith communities, and to strengthen <br /> and expand Hispanic/Latino ministries that have been <br /> started over the last few years. Subsequently faith communities <br /> have been started in Centreville, Clanton, <br /> Mobile, Montgomery, Tuscaloosa, and Wetumpka, <br /> Alabama; and in Pensacola, Florida, utilizing lay missioner <br /> and pastor-mentor teams. <br /> Today this conference has at least seven United <br /> Methodist worship services conducted in Spanish each <br /> week with the average attendance ranging from 25 to <br /> 70. Some of the lay missioners that received training <br /> <b>1036 DCA Advance Edition <br /> </b>have also been working within the new missions or congregations <br /> to develop or lead their various ministries. <br /> Through the help of a couple of commissioned missionaries, <br /> many social, translation, health, and immigration <br /> services and programs have been developed in some of <br /> these new congregations. Because of the growth in <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries, in January 2007, the conference <br /> decided to hire a conference coordinator of <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries to continue to strengthen and <br /> expand its ministries. <br /> <b>Brooklyn Success Stories <br /> </b>The National Plan&rsquo;s Congregational Mobilization <br /> Process has helped revitalize established Hispanic/ <br /> Latino local churches that were in a declining cycle. <br /> Such was the case of Fourth Avenue United Methodist <br /> Church in Brooklyn, New York, a church that began as <br /> an English-speaking mission in 1873 and built its first <br /> chapel in 1877. Due to ethnic and demographic changes <br /> in the community, an Hispanic mission was started in <br /> 1977. Since then it has been led by five different pastors <br /> and has had two fruitful but short growth periods. <br /> In 2002, the church was more focused on itself, acting <br /> more like a club than a church reaching out to its <br /> community. Internal tensions and conflicts drained its <br /> leadership, energy, and spiritual resources. The church <br /> debated whether to begin the three-stage, guided <br /> Congregational Mobilization Process of planning for the <br /> future which includes analyzing itself and its community, <br /> training local leaders, and finally implementing <br /> new ministries. <br /> Fourth Avenue United Methodist Church did decide <br /> to go through that process, and because of the successful <br /> changes brought about through that process, the <br /> church was able to make much needed repairs costing <br /> over $100,000 to its building in 2003 and 2004. It had <br /> not been able to do so before that time. Furthermore, <br /> through the process, the church was able to start new <br /> Sunday school classes and adult education English <br /> classes in collaboration with the city. It was also able to <br /> attract and integrate new members into the church as it <br /> continued to expand the variety of community ministries <br /> that it offered to its community, including a food pantry <br /> and rehabilitation services for substance abuse, physical <br /> abuse, and gangs. The current pastor reports that, thanks <br /> to the Congregational Mobilization Process, the church <br /> has been revitalized and has transformed its ministries <br /> and building. It now sees itself as a center for mission <br /> and evangelization. <br /> <b>Brazilian Ministries <br /> </b>A new element in the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry for 2005&ndash;2008 was the incorporation <br /> of Brazilian ministries. There are currently <br /> ministries with Brazilians in four annual conferences: <br /> Greater New Jersey, New England, Florida, and North <br /> Georgia. Two other annual conferences are seriously <br /> considering starting Brazilian ministries in the very near <br /> future. Modules I and II have already been translated <br /> into Portuguese and a core group of Brazilian facilitators <br /> have been trained to lead the workshops throughout <br /> the country. <br /> In 2006, the Module I pilot workshop was held as a <br /> joint project with the New England and Greater New <br /> Jersey Conferences and their respective Brazilian ministries. <br /> In Clearwater, Florida, a new work has begun. <br /> The Brazilian ministry sponsored by the Verdad y Vida <br /> United Methodist Church held its first worship service <br /> in Portuguese on May 27, 2007. This ministry is led by <br /> two lay persons in coordination with the pastor. There is <br /> an average attendance of 20 people in the worship services. <br /> <b>Transformation Sparked by Pastoral Leadership <br /> </b>Pastoral leadership is critical for developing new <br /> congregations and new ministries among Hispanics/ <br /> Latinos. In Nebraska a few years ago a woman who had <br /> received seminary training in her native country found <br /> herself at a crucial point in her life, facing possible deportation, <br /> frustrated with a dilapidated building, and working <br /> in a small congregation with very limited resources. <br /> Through a compassionate United Methodist non- <br /> Hispanic/Latino pastor&rsquo;s intervention, she was able to <br /> submit her visa papers and talk with the bishop who asked <br /> her if she was interested in working with that conference. <br /> Her seminary work was evaluated by the General <br /> Board of Higher Education and Ministry, and then she <br /> was sent to a Spanish-language Course of Study School <br /> in Dallas to complete the studies that she needed to <br /> become a certified local pastor. She was appointed as an <br /> associate pastor of a non-Hispanic/Latino church with <br /> the intention of developing ministries with the <br /> Hispanics/Latinos in the city of Imperial. &ldquo;Through the <br /> grace of God we have established regular [worship] <br /> services, Bible studies, English as a Second Language <br /> programs, tutoring and afterschool programs, a United <br /> Methodist Women&rsquo;s group, and presently we have <br /> begun two faith communities,&rdquo; reports this local pastor. <br /> She has attended Module I, II, and III workshops, and <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1037 <br /> </b>recently was named as district coordinator of <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> <b>Pacific Northwest Success Stories <br /> </b>The National Plan&rsquo;s annual conference grants have <br /> stimulated conferences to start or expand their ministries <br /> with Hispanics/Latinos, as already mentioned, and they <br /> have also assisted conferences to develop their pastoral and <br /> lay leadership. The Pacific Northwest Annual Conference <br /> received a National Plan grant a few years ago. The grant <br /> has helped the conference expand its ministries with <br /> Hispanics/Latinos to a number of cities and towns that did <br /> not have any such ministries. The conference now is reaching <br /> Hispanics/Latinos in two distinct geographical regions: <br /> one on each side of the Cascade Mountains, with two centers <br /> for Hispanic/Latino ministries, one in Burien and <br /> another in Toppenish, Washington. An Hispanic pastor and <br /> a non-Hispanic/Latino pastor are the current directors of <br /> these respective centers. The conference has <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries in three out of its five districts, <br /> and it hopes to begin work in the remaining districts by <br /> 2008. It currently has nine new faith community locations <br /> for mission work, with seven of them already in operation; <br /> there are four other faith communities that existed before <br /> this quadrennium. <br /> To prepare its leaders, the conference held a <br /> Module I workshop for lay missioner and pastor-mentor <br /> teams in the spring of 2006. It has also enlisted and <br /> begun the training of six local pastors, and hopes to <br /> begin the training process with an additional five within <br /> a year. This is a critical step for the conference to guarantee <br /> trained leadership as it seeks to expand its <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries beyond what they currently <br /> have. The National Plan&rsquo;s grant became the catalyst to <br /> bring together resources within and beyond the conferences <br /> for the expansion and support of these ministries. <br /> <b>Oregon-Idaho Success Stories <br /> </b>In 2004, the Oregon/Idaho Conference received a <br /> National Plan annual conference grant and a commissioned <br /> missionary to implement the work of a newly <br /> created Hispanic/Latino Ministry Training Institute. A <br /> non-Hispanic/Latino lay missioner who had worked as <br /> part of a pastor-mentor team in a local congregation outreach <br /> project was chosen as the Institute coordinator in <br /> mid-2004. The Institute&rsquo;s purpose is to instruct <br /> &ldquo;Hispanic and non-Hispanic leadership in developing <br /> Hispanic and other outreach ministries.&rdquo;<br /> The coordinator reports that the Institute was established <br /> &ldquo;through the support of the conference Hispanic <br /> Ministry Council, the supervision of the Western district <br /> superintendent, the partnership with the Office of <br /> Connectional Ministries, and the educational support of <br /> the consultants and facilitators and staff of the National <br /> Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry.&rdquo; The Institute has <br /> recruited a small core of facilitators and instructors on a <br /> &ldquo;needs&rdquo; basis, and has become a mobile training center, <br /> offering training events at local, district, and conference <br /> levels throughout the conference. <br /> Such events have included Module I and II workshops <br /> in two different cities (one in partnership with a <br /> neighboring conference), a jurisdictional event with representatives <br /> from three conferences attending, district <br /> orientation events, and numerous local church presentations <br /> about Hispanic/Latino ministries. It also offered its <br /> constituents cross-cultural experiences, including mission <br /> trips within and outside the conference, multicultural <br /> and bilingual camps in partnership with the <br /> conference Camp and Retreat Ministries. The Institute <br /> has also enabled the jurisdiction to host a facilitators&rsquo;<br /> workshop, and has worked ecumenically on information- <br /> sharing events and presentations on immigration <br /> issues. Spanish language training classes have also been <br /> organized and offered periodically. <br /> As a result of the work of the Institute, local <br /> churches have begun new outreach projects like ESL <br /> classes in two cities, a multicultural day camp, justice <br /> studies/ministries on immigration issues, and special <br /> seasonal campaigns. The Institute&rsquo;s work has also <br /> increased the intentionality of conference and district <br /> leaders in discussing and planning for Hispanic/Latino <br /> ministries. Another concrete result was the recruitment <br /> and securing of a second commissioned missionary to <br /> work in a local setting in Idaho in 2005. This missionary <br /> has started a number of community ministries including <br /> ESL and computer classes, a children&rsquo;s art program, <br /> clothing bank, counseling group for women, soccer <br /> league, as well as a worshipping congregation with an <br /> average weekly attendance of 55. <br /> <b>Seminary Success Stories <br /> </b>Enlisting and identifying pastoral leaders has been <br /> an ongoing challenge for conferences seeking to establish <br /> and maintain Hispanic/Latino ministries and has <br /> been critical for the development of those ministries. <br /> The National Plan grants to seminaries have often been <br /> the catalyst for starting new and innovative ministries <br /> addressing this need. Such is the case of a grant given to <br /> Perkins School of Theology through the General Board <br /> of Higher Education and Ministry. <br /> <b>1038 DCA Advance Edition <br /> </b>In the summer of 2006, the Hispanic Youth <br /> Leadership Academy graduated its largest class, 54 <br /> Hispanic/Latino youth leaders. The Academy&rsquo;s coordinator <br /> reported that these youth have been involved in <br /> district and conference activities in their respective conferences <br /> as well as with MARCHA, the national <br /> Hispanic caucus. Two youth from the Nebraska <br /> Conference were trained as lay missioners with the <br /> National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry, and several <br /> others initiated their preparation processes for candidacy <br /> into ordained ministry. One of them is now at <br /> Wesley Seminary in Monterrey, Mexico, and the rest <br /> continue to explore their call to ministry. The coordinator <br /> expressed the hope that this Academy &ldquo;becomes <br /> embedded in the permanent structure of The United <br /> Methodist Church because it is profoundly needed <br /> within our church and more so in our Hispanic community.&rdquo;<br /> The Hispanic Youth Leadership Academy is a <br /> model that could be adapted and used in other conferences. <br /> <b>National Plan Assessment: Learnings <br /> </b>In early 2005, the Committee on Hispanic/Latino <br /> Ministries, responsible for overseeing the implementation <br /> of the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry, <br /> commissioned a task force to design and to carry out an <br /> assessment of the National Plan&rsquo;s implementation. The <br /> committee believed it was time to do this in order to <br /> make the necessary adjustments and enhance its development <br /> and implementation. The task force presented <br /> its findings to the committee in October 2006. <br /> The assessment included on-site interviews with <br /> conference leaders in nine annual conferences, telephone <br /> interviews with leaders in four other conferences, <br /> written questionnaires sent to various church leaders, <br /> including bishops, and information compiled from previous <br /> conference surveys held in the national office. The <br /> conferences that were interviewed were selected based <br /> on a statistical weighing, taking into account the Latino <br /> population and the Latino United Methodist membership <br /> within those conferences. <br /> The task force members interviewed Hispanic/Latino <br /> pastors, laity, and youth; non-Hispanic/Latino pastors; district <br /> superintendents; the bishop; and other conference <br /> leaders in each conference they visited or called. The task <br /> force collected and analyzed the data to discover how the <br /> conferences had implemented the National Plan and how <br /> well the National Plan, as a national strategy, had helped <br /> them. Since the task force consistently received similar <br /> feedback from the interviews, and the same feedback <br /> emerged from the written surveys, the task group is confident <br /> that its findings are valid, although they are the result <br /> of an anecdotal, observational, qualitative approach. <br /> <b>Successes of the National Plan <br /> </b>Conferences across the denomination universally <br /> credited the National Plan for stimulating and energizing <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministry efforts. <br /> </ul><li>The National Plan grants have served to jumpstart <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries in several conferences, <br /> opening the door for more comprehensive <br /> involvement, especially by those that actually <br /> developed strategic plans for Hispanic/Latino <br /> ministries as part of the grant application. <br /> </ul><li>The National Plan&rsquo;s recent efforts to develop and <br /> expand Brazilian ministries have also received <br /> recognition and praise by the conferences <br /> involved. <br /> </ul><li>The orientation of conferences, creation of <br /> resources, and the organizing of lay missioners <br /> and pastor-mentors training events were <br /> acknowledged everywhere as very successful. <br /> </ul><li>The general agencies have developed and produced <br /> much more material for Hispanic/Latino <br /> ministries than they had in the past or would have <br /> produced had there been no Plan. <br /> </ul><li>Many of the conferences visited considered the <br /> assessment itself to be helpful because it served <br /> as a catalyst for them to take stock of their <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries, celebrating accomplishments, <br /> networking leaders, regrouping leadership <br /> teams, and identifying gaps, weaknesses, <br /> and needed resources from within and beyond the <br /> conference. <br /> <b>Opportunities for Improving the Plan <br /> </b>The assessment study also revealed some important <br /> findings related to improving the National Plan&rsquo;s implementation. <br /> Among those findings are conceptual misunderstandings <br /> and challenges to the practical <br /> implementation. <br /> </ul><li>Some conference leaders have misunderstood the <br /> National Plan as merely a program or a means to <br /> secure grants for the conferences&rsquo; specific <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries rather than as means <br /> to assist conferences in developing a strategic <br /> plan for Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Others have misunderstood the National Plan as <br /> another denominational congregational development <br /> program, without taking into account the <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1039 <br /> </b>outreach and community ministries that are an <br /> integral part of the National Plan. <br /> </ul><li>The conference accompaniment process for the <br /> conference grants has not been consistently <br /> implemented, resulting in weak follow-up and <br /> evaluation of projects. <br /> </ul><li>Few conferences have developed and adopted <br /> comprehensive or strategic plans for the implementation <br /> of the National Plan. <br /> </ul><li>The inability to develop a well-coordinated effort <br /> to secure pastoral leadership in sufficient numbers <br /> has adversely affected the development and <br /> growth of Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> Hispanic/Latino candidates and potential candidates <br /> for ordained ministry need appropriate <br /> models for theological education that address <br /> their socioeconomic, familial, language, and <br /> legal status realities. <br /> </ul><li>The faith community model in many conferences <br /> is not being implemented or used as originally <br /> intended. Lay missioners have sometimes been <br /> used as local pastors without appropriate training, <br /> support, and guidance. The relationship <br /> between the lay missioners and their pastor-mentors <br /> is vital to the successful establishment and <br /> continuing growth of faith communities. In the <br /> cases where this relationship has been nonexistent <br /> or barely existent, those ministries have been <br /> short-lived. <br /> </ul><li>Non-Hispanic/Latino churches reaching out to <br /> Hispanics/Latinos need more resources, although <br /> some regional training events have taken place. <br /> In particular resources are needed that are aimed <br /> at developing intercultural competency skills and <br /> to sustaining ongoing ministries. <br /> </ul><li>There is a need for developing leadership and <br /> providing resources for ministries with second <br /> and third generation Hispanic/Latino persons and <br /> communities. <br /> </ul><li>The church needs to be engaged in the current <br /> critical social issues affecting Hispanic/Latino <br /> communities for at least two reasons: one, to <br /> accompany those communities in their daily <br /> struggle for basic human rights as Jesus taught <br /> us; and two, to accompany the clergy and lay <br /> leaders emerging from those communities as they <br /> develop ministries and their own leadership <br /> through The United Methodist Church. As part of <br /> this engagement in social issues, the communityorganizing <br /> dimension of such work needs to be <br /> highlighted and strengthened. <br /> <b><i>Future Opportunity <br /> </b></i>We celebrate with joy what has been accomplished <br /> through the grace of God and the leading of the Holy Spirit <br /> during this quadrennium. We see the fruits of the work that <br /> has been done in the immediate past. We know that as <br /> young plants need to be nurtured to give fruit in abundance, <br /> our church needs to nurture what has been planted and is <br /> growing. The assessment process was invaluable to help the <br /> Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries identify the <br /> Plan&rsquo;s weaknesses and focus on corrective strategies that <br /> will ensure the consolidation of the work that has been <br /> done. The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry, with <br /> the hard-won accomplishments and lessons of this quadrennium <br /> and the previous ones, has a valuable contribution to <br /> make in the future as The United Methodist Church ministers <br /> with and among Hispanic/Latino communities. The <br /> continued, dramatic growth of the Hispanic/Latino population <br /> in the US is an opportunity that the Lord has given us <br /> to reach out to new people with the gospel of Jesus Christ. <br /> Let us rejoice in the fruits and let us go forward, planting, <br /> nurturing, and harvesting. <br /> <b>APPENDIX TO REPORT <br /> </b>Projected # of <br /> Conference Latinos by 2011 <br /> California-Pacific 10,247,045 <br /> Rio Grande** 10,020,168 <br /> California-Nevada 4,724,971 <br /> Southwest Texas 3,680,861 <br /> New York 3,545,896 <br /> Desert Southwest 2,747,273 <br /> Florida 2,657,414 <br /> Texas 2,413,080 <br /> Northern Illinois 1,893,911 <br /> New Mexico 1,680,429 <br /> Greater New Jersey 1,546,426 <br /> Rocky Mountain 1,446,966 <br /> North Texas 1,383,387 <br /> Central Texas 862,411 <br /> New England 811,985 <br /> North Georgia 754,518 <br /> Pacific Northwest 663,584 <br /> Virginia 586,733 <br /> Oregon-Idaho 584,237 <br /> <i>** Note: The Rio Grande Conference covers the geographic <br /> area of Texas and New Mexico. <br /> <b></i>1040 DCA Advance Edition <br /> <i>Vision <br /> </b></i>The vision of the National Plan, based on the experience <br /> of the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s power on the day of <br /> Pentecost, is to be the &ldquo;Church for all the Nations.&rdquo; It is <br /> a vision of &ldquo;a dynamic and growing church, joyously <br /> sharing and living the good news of Jesus Christ in a <br /> multiplicity of places . . . and in a variety of cultural settings,&rdquo;<br /> (1992 National Plan Report) that affirms the cultural <br /> identities and not just the language of those among <br /> whom we are called to witness. The vision is then of a <br /> church where all persons may be able to experience the <br /> transforming power of the good news of the gospel in <br /> their own language and in their own cultural context and <br /> traditions. <br /> The National Plan envisions a church where persons <br /> are empowered by the Holy Spirit to announce the <br /> good news of the reign of God and to become instruments <br /> of healing and agents of both personal and social <br /> transformation. The National Plan envisions the Holy <br /> Spirit transforming persons into communities of faith, <br /> the church, that transcend their ethnic, cultural, geographic, <br /> and religious limitations to become transformed <br /> into a movement and a pilgrim people as it multiplies <br /> itself and extends itself from &ldquo;. . . Jerusalem, Judea, <br /> Samaria, and to the ends of the earth&rdquo; (Acts 1:8). We <br /> understand the church as a people of God that is <br /> prophetic because God seeks the transformation of our <br /> world. The National Plan envisions that everyone in the <br /> church is called to fulfill its mission of making disciples <br /> of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world. It is, <br /> therefore, the vision of a church that both affirms and <br /> practices the priesthood of all believers. It is the vision <br /> of a church whose organizational and institutional <br /> nature, while necessary for the fulfillment of its mission, <br /> becomes secondary to its organic, missional, and movement <br /> nature. <br /> To move further toward this vision, the National <br /> Plan sees the next quadrennium as a time to move out <br /> into the barrios and cities from the Upper Room where <br /> we have been preparing ourselves for the task of transformation. <br /> Having spent a year engaged in a lengthy <br /> process of analysis and listening to the reflections of people <br /> engaged in Hispanic/Latino ministries within annual <br /> conferences, we are proposing several new directions in <br /> the work of the National Plan. Having heard that annual <br /> conferences are asking for more regular communications <br /> and <i>accompa&#241;amiento</i>, we are proposing to increase the <br /> national office&rsquo;s communications capacity as well as the <br /> capacity to provide ongoing <i>accompa&#241;amiento </i>to annual <br /> conferences. Our assessment revealed the urgent need to <br /> provide greater access to seminary education for <br /> Hispanic/Latino clergy. Therefore we intend to emphasize <br /> the creation of new models of pastoral education <br /> appropriate for the Hispanic/Latino context. Recognizing <br /> that immigration will continue to define the Hispanic <br /> community, we will encourage more congregations <br /> throughout the church to become engaged in providing <br /> varying forms of hospitality to the new arrivals along <br /> with actively addressing other social concerns within <br /> Hispanic/Latino communities. <br /> We realize that the well-being of the immigrant <br /> generation will enable the second generation to flourish. <br /> Just as Jeremiah (29:28) urged the exiles to prosper in a <br /> foreign land by raising their children and seeking the <br /> well-being of the land in which they were living, <br /> Hispanics/Latinos must do the same in the US. The <br /> number of second-generation Hispanics/Latinos aged 5 <br /> to 19 years old is projected to more than double between <br /> 2000 and 2020, growing from 4.4 million to 9.0 million <br /> people, so that US-born Hispanics/Latinos will make up <br /> one in every seven children entering school over the next <br /> 20 years. It is now time for all of our churches to develop <br /> ministry strategies aimed at working with the second <br /> generation, 93% of whom are either bilingual or <br /> English-dominant speakers. They are also much bettereducated <br /> than their immigrant parents, with 44% of <br /> them having completed some college education or more. <br /> The continued growth of the Hispanic/Latino population <br /> in the US and its multicultural nature and the <br /> divine mandate to proclaim the gospel to all peoples <br /> reaffirm the vision of the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry, a vision which has guided it <br /> since its beginnings. The United Methodist Church, <br /> through its annual conferences in the US, must take seriously <br /> the demographic realities that all conferences are <br /> facing. Over 70% (or 44 out of 61) of these conferences <br /> are projected to have over 100,000 Hispanics/Latinos by <br /> 2011. By the same year, over 30% of them (19) are projected <br /> to have over 500,000 Hispanics/Latinos. This <br /> population growth is an opportunity for our church to <br /> <b>Recommended Plan of Action for the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry for the 2009&ndash;2012 Quadrennium <br /> Global Ministries 1041 <br /> </b>continue to respond to Christ&rsquo;s calling to collaborate in <br /> His ministry of reaching all people with the gospel, <br /> making disciples for the transformation of the world, a <br /> world that God has loved so much that the Word was <br /> made flesh. <br /> The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry <br /> continues its deep commitment to assign and accompany <br /> annual conferences in the development and <br /> strengthening of Hispanic/Latino ministries. We understand <br /> and value the significant role that annual conferences <br /> fulfill as the basic unit of our connection. It is <br /> through our partnerships with annual conferences that <br /> the National Plan has been implemented and come to <br /> fruition. It has also been through the relationship with <br /> annual conferences that we have come to know and <br /> understand the direction that God is leading us as we <br /> move into a new quadrennium. We believe that God is <br /> leading us to commit our resources of time, leaders, and <br /> finances to four national strategies: <br /> </ul><li>Congregational development, <br /> </ul><li>Advocacy regarding immigration and other critical <br /> social issues, <br /> </ul><li>Mobilization and <i>acompa&#241;amiento </i>(accompaniment) <br /> of annual conferences and local churches, <br /> and <br /> </ul><li>Lay and clergy leadership formation. <br /> We propose to accompany annual conferences in <br /> their journeys with Hispanic/Latino ministries primarily <br /> through a cadre of national missionaries who will focus <br /> on congregational development in Hispanic/Latino contexts, <br /> immigration, and mobilization. We pray for the <br /> wisdom and power of the Holy Spirit that we may be <br /> faithful to God&rsquo;s leadership. <br /> <b><i>National Strategy <br /> </i>Development of New Congregations <br /> </b>From the National Plan&rsquo;s perspective, we understand <br /> the creation of new congregations is not an end in <br /> itself. Rather, new congregations are strategic arenas <br /> through which the extension of the good news of the <br /> gospel can occur; they are places where we can &ldquo;bring <br /> good news to the poor, . . . proclaim release to the captives <br /> and recovery of sight to the blind . . . let the <br /> oppressed go free, and . . . proclaim the year of the <br /> Lord&rsquo;s favor&rdquo; (Luke 4:18b-19). Creating new congregations, <br /> therefore, is more than establishing another institution. <br /> It is an opportunity to create a community of <br /> faith, the place where the church seeks to fulfill its mission&mdash;<br /> making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation <br /> of the world. <br /> The National Plan has a contribution to make to the <br /> national and denominational dialogue related to establishing <br /> new congregations, and that contribution is the <br /> planning of faith communities or the formation of small <br /> evangelistic groups, meeting in homes, businesses, public <br /> buildings, and other places. The faith communities <br /> are created: <br /> </ul><li>To &ldquo;worship . . . God and . . . study the Scriptures <br /> . . . and seek to do God&rsquo;s will . . . in their own setting.&rdquo;<br /> </ul><li>To the extent that they multiply, to &ldquo;promote full <br /> congregational development by sharing their <br /> faith, inviting others to follow the Lord, and seeking <br /> ways to be involved in whatever forms of <br /> ministry and advocacy for justice the Lord <br /> requires in their communities.&rdquo;<br /> </ul><li>To &ldquo;understand themselves as centers for evangelism, <br /> mission action, and mission training, <br /> both at the local level and globally.&rdquo;<br /> </ul><li>To contribute, from the very outset, &ldquo;to their support <br /> as well as to the total mission of the church.&rdquo;<br /> Faith communities &ldquo;will be organically related to <br /> existing charges . . . until . . . they may develop into congregations, <br /> or join other similar groups to form a new <br /> congregation.&rdquo; [<i>The National Plan for Hispanic/Latino <br /> Ministry of The United Methodist Church</i>, pp. 69-70.] <br /> Starting new faith communities and new congregations, <br /> we understand, can begin with a local church, district, <br /> or other sponsors, but they need to seek <br /> connectional collaboration to ensure their support, nurture, <br /> and growth. We recommend a process of acompa&#241;amiento <br /> (accompaniment) for a new faith <br /> community&rsquo;s, or a new congregation&rsquo;s, theological-doctrinal, <br /> missional and disciple-making, and organizational <br /> formation. <br /> <b>Development of Ministry on Immigration <br /> and Other Social Issues <br /> </b>An integral part to the development of new congregations <br /> is the development of community ministries or, <br /> in other words, justice ministries that seek to transform <br /> and eradicate poverty, racism, and cultural, social, and <br /> economic marginalization that impoverished people suffer; <br /> particularly the ethnic minority population of this <br /> country. <br /> <b>1042 DCA Advance Edition <br /> </b>According to the Census Bureau, half of the <br /> Hispanic/Latino population growth up to 2000 exists <br /> because of the birth rate, but the other half occurred <br /> because of immigration. Global immigration is transforming <br /> the US and other countries in profound ways. <br /> While the number of immigrants coming into this country <br /> has already peaked, according to the Census <br /> Bureau&rsquo;s projections, it will continue to have a significant <br /> impact on the population growth of this country. It <br /> is becoming a basic reality that will influence the future <br /> economic, political, social, and cultural development of <br /> this country, provoking changes to which the church <br /> will also have to respond. <br /> The United Methodist Church has approached <br /> immigration as a moral and national policy issue. In <br /> 1988, the Council of Bishops issued a pastoral letter on <br /> immigration entitled, &ldquo;On Undocumented Migration: To <br /> Love the Sojourner,&rdquo; and the General Conference has <br /> enacted a series of resolutions on immigration. The <br /> church&rsquo;s intent has been clear as Leviticus 19:33-34 <br /> teaches, &ldquo;When an alien resides with you in your land, <br /> you shall not oppress the alien. The alien who resides <br /> with you shall be to you as the citizen among you; you <br /> shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the <br /> land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.&rdquo; However, this <br /> intent has not always born fruit in local settings where <br /> United Methodists encounter immigrants in their daily <br /> lives. <br /> At a time when our country continues to experience <br /> the influx of immigrants, particularly Latinos, a flurry of <br /> anti-immigrant propaganda, stepped-up border enforcement, <br /> and debate of local and federal immigration legislation, <br /> the National Plan proposes to intensify its focus <br /> and commitment to developing a national strategy and <br /> ministries at local church and conference levels to work <br /> in support of immigrants within our denomination. The <br /> National Plan recommends developing community centers, <br /> to offer legal assistance and training opportunities, <br /> and to seek the empowerment that facilitates and allows <br /> immigrants to live and enjoy fully their basic human <br /> rights. Our hope and goal would be that both local <br /> Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino United <br /> Methodist churches will become known in their communities <br /> as places where immigrants are welcomed and <br /> included in our congregational life so they can find <br /> refuge and support. Our commitment is to work with <br /> other United Methodist and ecumenical leaders of comprehensive <br /> immigration reform that brings justice to all <br /> people. For such work, we believe that collaborating and <br /> networking with Justice for Our Neighbors and other <br /> ecumenical organizations with aims similar to ours can <br /> increase our effectiveness and expand our reach. We <br /> understand that this is what God requires of us as people <br /> of God. <br /> As United Methodists we believe that: &ldquo;Racism <br /> plagues and cripples our growth in Christ, inasmuch as <br /> it is antithetical to the gospel itself&rdquo; (Social Principles of <br /> The United Methodist Church, paragraph 162A). We <br /> know racism to be a sin, for all persons are of sacred <br /> worth. We call upon persons and every social institution <br /> to work against any and all forms of racism. At the same <br /> time we recognize that the church is not yet free of its <br /> own institutional racism. The United Methodist Church <br /> has not always known how to welcome all of God&rsquo;s children <br /> and has all too often excluded some because of <br /> their culture and the color of their skin. The National <br /> Plan for Hispanic/ Latino Ministry exhorts our church to <br /> continue aggressively addressing the elimination of the <br /> sin of racism, in society and within the church. The <br /> National Plan commits to assisting the church in reaching <br /> this mighty goal for the healing of the community of <br /> faith and the world. <br /> As an immigrant people, many of whom are not yet <br /> citizens, Hispanics/Latinos suffer from low levels of <br /> education, economic exploitation, and a lack of access <br /> to quality healthcare. Table I gives a comparative look at <br /> the well-being of Hispanics/Latinos compared to other <br /> major groups in the American population. The low levels <br /> of education among Hispanics/Latinos stand out <br /> sharply as a major concern. The low incomes of <br /> Hispanics/Latinos and African-Americans have serious <br /> healthcare consequences for both communities. <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1043 <br /> </b>The Plan will encourage an increased focus on the <br /> myriad of social concerns present within <br /> Hispanic/Latino communities. The National Plan recommends <br /> that we continue to work with the General <br /> Board of Church and Society as it develops our church&rsquo;s <br /> responses to various social, immigration, and justice <br /> issues that arise. The National Plan also is proposing <br /> encouraging and promoting community organizing and <br /> networking at the local and state level in collaboration <br /> with other community entities that share our values and <br /> concerns on specific issues. <br /> <b><i>Annual Conference and Local Church <br /> Strategy <br /> </i>Mobilization and Acompa&#241;amiento <br /> (Accompaniment) <br /> </b>The experience of the past quadrennium has confirmed <br /> for us that as we work together, holding up the <br /> vision of God&rsquo;s preferred future for us and all of creation, <br /> God accompanies us with mercy and faithfulness. <br /> God&rsquo;s faithfulness inspires us to a full commitment to <br /> God&rsquo;s hope for us. We must do no less than faithful <br /> work that is strategic in nature, not merely activism, and <br /> that brings God&rsquo;s transforming power to local churches <br /> and communities. Such strategic and transforming work <br /> implies self-reflection and concerted analysis of our <br /> contexts of ministry so that relevant and helpful models <br /> of ministry can be created for service to the world in the <br /> name of Jesus Christ. It is not work that can be done <br /> alone. <br /> Accompanying each other in this vital and important <br /> work of God has led the National Plan to the development <br /> of a process called &ldquo;mobilization.&rdquo; The process <br /> of mobilization is grounded in the commitment to <br /> accompany annual conferences and local churches as <br /> they seek to be faithful to God. <br /> Mobilization implies a movement not only of a few <br /> leaders at the conference, district, or local level, but a <br /> movement of the people of God, of the whole church, of <br /> those who have committed their lives to Jesus Christ. It <br /> is a movement of a believing people, that they may fulfill <br /> their calling to the priesthood of all believers. This <br /> process is implemented in the different levels of the <br /> church. This transforming dynamic of <i>acompa&#241;amiento</i>, <br /> or accompaniment, will be done through the work of the <br /> general agencies under the direction of the National <br /> Committee of Hispanic/ Latino Ministry. The National <br /> Plan proposes to enter into a covenant of collaboration <br /> and mission with a number of annual conferences. <br /> These annual conferences will be selected on the basis <br /> of population concentration and growth and readiness to <br /> develop and implement the proposed quadrennial goals <br /> described below. <br /> <b>Conference Mobilization <br /> </b>The 2005&ndash;2006 assessment showed that working <br /> with the bishops, cabinets, and conference leaders, particularly <br /> the conference committee that oversees the <br /> planning, development, and implementation of <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries, is vital to mobilizing conferences <br /> and local churches for this work. The National <br /> Plan commits to work with conference and local church <br /> leaders through the services of consultants and facilitators <br /> to assist annual conferences in the formulation and <br /> implementation of strategic conference plans for min- <br /> <b>1044 DCA Advance Edition <br /> <i>Table I: Educational Attainment and Medium Family Income <br /> </b></i>Percent High School Percent Bachelor&rsquo;s Median Family <br /> Graduate or more Degree or more Income <br /> Hispanic 52 10 $34,397 <br /> Mexican only 46 8 $33,518 <br /> Asian 80 44 $59,324 <br /> African-American 72 14 $33,255 <br /> White 84 26 $53,029 <br /> Total 80 24 $50,046 <br /> <i>Source: We the People and Statistical Abstract of the United States 2004-2005 Census 2000 Summary File 3. <br /> </i>istries with the Hispanic/Latino population. <br /> Consequently, as it did in the 2005&ndash;2008 proposal <br /> approved by the 2004 General Conference, the National <br /> Plan recommends that conferences form and organize a <br /> committee on Hispanic/Latino ministries, or its equivalent, <br /> to develop and implement their conference strategic <br /> plans. <br /> The 2004 General Conference also called for every <br /> conference to develop a strategic, comprehensive plan <br /> for ministries with Hispanics/Latinos. (See &ldquo;Annual <br /> Conference Strategic, Comprehensive Plans for <br /> Hispanic/Latino-Latina Ministries,&rdquo; <i>The Book of <br /> Resolutions of The United Methodist Church, 2004, </i>p. <br /> 138-140.) In the <i>acompa&#241;amiento </i>and mobilization <br /> process, it is critical that the National Plan&rsquo;s consultants <br /> relate to these committees because these committees are <br /> the leaders who provide direct planning and follow-up <br /> for the conference&rsquo;s Hispanic/Latino ministries. Such a <br /> committee shall be composed of persons representing <br /> local Hispanic/Latino ministries, representing districts <br /> where there are significant concentrations of <br /> Hispanic/Latino populations, and district superintendents <br /> and appropriate conference staff to provide linkages <br /> to conference structures, personnel, and resources. <br /> This committee shall reflect the diversity of the <br /> conference. Such a committee shall have five basic tasks <br /> related to Hispanic/Latino ministries: interpreting and <br /> advocating, strategic planning, providing for appropriate <br /> leadership training, securing needed resources, and <br /> monitoring and evaluating the implementation of the <br /> conference strategic plan. The National Plan further <br /> commits to accompany annual conferences and local <br /> churches through seed money grants, print and multimedia <br /> resources, training opportunities, and ongoing <br /> accompaniment through its consultants and other personnel. <br /> For targeted conferences, such training may be <br /> required. <br /> <b>Local Church Mobilization <br /> </b>The National Plan affirms the local church as the <br /> basic context in which ministry happens and where &ldquo;the <br /> church encounters the world.&rdquo; The local church &ldquo;is the <br /> strategic base from which Christians move out to the <br /> structures of society&rdquo; (<i>The Book of Discipline, 2004</i>, <br /> ¶202) to transform the world. Both established <br /> Hispanic/Latino churches and non-Hispanic/Latino <br /> churches must mobilize. <br /> The National Plan proposes to continue to assist a <br /> number of established Hispanic/Latino churches in different <br /> conferences in order to accompany them in a <br /> process of revitalization and/or transformation so that <br /> they can become missional churches. This revitalization <br /> process is known as the &ldquo;Congregational Mobilization <br /> Process.&rdquo; Through this Congregational Mobilization <br /> Process, the National Plan proposes to introduce these <br /> local churches to a transformation process that will help <br /> them analyze themselves and their communities, formulate <br /> a strategic local missional plan for their churches, <br /> train their leaders for their designed ministries, and <br /> implement their plan. Through this process, the National <br /> Plan proposes to provide consultants that will accompany <br /> these congregations as they revitalize their mission <br /> and ministries and become centers of evangelization, of <br /> justice, of domestic and global mission, for equipping <br /> leaders, and of worship and nurture. <br /> The National Plan proposes to strengthen the engagement <br /> of non-Hispanic/Latino churches through training <br /> events, print and multimedia materials, a methodology of <br /> work, and an accompaniment process. It will follow-up <br /> with those leaders already trained for this cross-cultural <br /> work and expand its efforts in order to include and incorporate <br /> new leaders. The National Plan will enter into collaboration <br /> with non-Hispanic/Latino churches, selected <br /> according to the concentration of the Hispanic/Latino population, <br /> in different conferences or geographic areas, in <br /> order that they may initiate new, and strengthen existing, <br /> faith communities and community ministries. <br /> The National Plan will offer non-Hispanic/Latino <br /> churches training events designed to deepen cultural <br /> sensitivity and to develop intercultural competency, <br /> including skills for intercultural communication. Such <br /> training will help develop and strengthen relationships <br /> between Hispanic/Latino and non-Hispanic/Latino persons <br /> and churches, thus strengthening new and existing <br /> Hispanic/Latino faith communities and congregations <br /> and/or community ministries, and equip lay missioners <br /> and pastor-mentor teams for the ministry of building <br /> faith communities and/or community ministries. In this <br /> way non-Hispanic/Latino churches will be able to <br /> accompany the development of faith communities and <br /> community ministries in culturally appropriate ways. <br /> <b><i>Leadership Formation <br /> </b></i>One of the National Plan&rsquo;s priorities in the upcoming <br /> quadrennium is opening broader ministry training <br /> opportunities for Hispanic/Latino clergy. In past quadrennia <br /> great emphasis has been placed on lay missioner <br /> training. However, the National Committee on <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry&rsquo;s detailed assessment con- <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1045 <br /> </b>ducted in 2005&ndash;2006 identified clergy training as a critical <br /> shortcoming that is holding back the growth of <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministry in The United Methodist <br /> Church. Currently about 28% of Hispanic/Latino pastors <br /> nationally are serving as local pastors, but in some <br /> conferences where Hispanic/Latino ministry has <br /> recently begun, the percentage is much higher. The danger <br /> exists of Hispanic/Latino pastors becoming a second- <br /> class clergy group in our denomination. <br /> In a study report entitled &ldquo;A Demographic Profile <br /> of Latino/Seminarians,&rdquo; the Latino Institute at the <br /> University of Notre Dame found that Latino/as remain <br /> the most underrepresented minority group in US seminaries <br /> and schools of theology. The report asserts that <br /> &ldquo;cultivating a vibrant and well-trained cadre of Latino <br /> religious leaders is critical for the vitality of the US <br /> Latino community.&rdquo; Indeed, the study concludes that <br /> &ldquo;ensuring that the diversity of the Latino community is <br /> reflected in the leadership of American Christian congregations <br /> is critical for the health of both our religious <br /> communities and our broader public discourse.&rdquo;6 <br /> We are encouraged by the success of the vocational <br /> discernment program for Hispanic youth at Perkins <br /> School of Theology and the Hispanic Academy created <br /> by Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary and the <br /> Northern Illinois Conference. These two programs are <br /> good examples of innovative approaches to the recruitment, <br /> training, and mentoring of a new generation of <br /> Hispanic/Latino pastoral leaders. Since Hispanics/ <br /> Latinos are a very youthful population, it will be important <br /> to build strong programs that begin mentoring youth <br /> in high school, following them through college into <br /> seminary. <br /> Nevertheless, many conference leaders, in their <br /> eagerness to secure a pastoral leader, have recruited pastors <br /> from other denominations and other countries. Even <br /> though the National Plan has designed, through the <br /> General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, an <br /> intensive workshop to assist such pastors to become oriented <br /> and acclimated to the US and the United <br /> Methodist ethos, doctrine, polity, and practice, very few <br /> conferences have sent these recruited pastoral leaders to <br /> these periodic workshops. The lack of such training and <br /> orientation results in frustration, disappointment, and <br /> wasted resources at the local level. <br /> The existing established pathways to ordination <br /> within The United Methodist Church that require formal <br /> seminary training are ill-suited to the reality of both the <br /> native-born and foreign-born Hispanic/Latino population. <br /> Too many highly gifted, committed <br /> Hispanic/Latino leaders lack the educational credentials, <br /> English language skills, finances, and sometimes <br /> the legal residency status, to attend seminary. A selected <br /> survey in our denomination a few years ago revealed <br /> that the Course of Study School, currently offered in <br /> Spanish in three of our United Methodist seminaries, <br /> was the primary route for theological education for <br /> about three-fourths (76%) of the present and past <br /> Hispanic/Latino pastors. Currently, United Methodist <br /> seminaries do not accept Course of Study credits as <br /> transferable toward a Master of Divinity degree, even <br /> though other seminaries do accept these credits. Many <br /> Boards of Ordained Ministry are skeptical of candidates <br /> who come from nontraditional programs outside the <br /> United Methodist system of seminary education. For <br /> Hispanic/Latino pastors who are interested in pastoral <br /> ministry, the traditional three- or four-year seminary <br /> curriculum is not workable when they have to support <br /> their families and have limited economic resources. This <br /> has led some of these promising Hispanic/Latino candidates <br /> to leave our denomination for those in which seminaries <br /> are more flexible and supportive. For others, <br /> more recently, lay missioner training has become the <br /> initial pathway into pastoral ministry and the only theological <br /> training provided by our denomination for some <br /> local pastors. <br /> The National Plan recommends that our church <br /> seek new and innovative approaches to opening wider <br /> access to theological education for the preparation of <br /> clergy for our local churches, annual conferences, and <br /> denomination. During the next quadrennium, the <br /> National Plan proposes to research alternative theological <br /> educational models that may help open new opportunities <br /> for a larger number of Hispanic/Latino pastors <br /> to obtain the necessary credentials for pastoral work. It <br /> also proposes to seek United Methodist undergraduate <br /> institutions that could combine undergraduate and <br /> Master of Divinity degrees. The National Plan will work <br /> with the General Board of Higher Education and <br /> Ministry to use its seminary and institute grants to <br /> encourage new, innovative, nontraditional pathways to <br /> Master of Divinity completion, including recognition of <br /> Course of Study credits. <br /> With regard to lay leadership development, the <br /> National Plan proposes to update its basic Lay <br /> Missioner and Pastor-Mentor Teams Training Program <br /> in collaboration with the General Board of Discipleship, <br /> and to continue to develop more specialized program- <br /> <b>1046 DCA Advance Edition <br /> </b>matic training for mission leaders through the development <br /> of new Module III workshops in collaboration <br /> with the four general program agencies. The ministry of <br /> the lay missioner is a team ministry with the pastormentor <br /> to establish faith communities and community <br /> ministries. The relationship of the lay missioner and the <br /> pastor-mentor is critical to starting and sustaining successful <br /> ministries. One of the weaknesses the National <br /> Plan&rsquo;s assessment noted was the absence of pastor-mentors <br /> assigned to work with a lay missioner or the poor <br /> quality of the relationship due to language, culture, and <br /> understanding of the purpose of the team. Therefore in <br /> the updating of existing workshops and the creation of <br /> new workshops, attention must be paid to utilizing the <br /> workshops to cultivate a healthy team relationship and <br /> to build a network of teams for mutual support. To help <br /> improve and expand the Training Program, National <br /> Plan proposes to continue to recruit, equip, and update <br /> facilitators and consultants to assist in leading these <br /> workshops in different conferences and geographic <br /> regions of the country as well as build a network of support. <br /> In the mobilization and acompa&#241;amiento process <br /> discussed in the previous section, it is critical that the <br /> National Plan&rsquo;s consultants relate to the conference <br /> committees for Hispanic/Latino ministries because <br /> these committees are the leaders who provide direct <br /> planning and follow-up for the conference&rsquo;s <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries. The National Plan proposes <br /> to continue recruiting, equipping, and updating consultants <br /> who assist annual conferences in developing and <br /> implementing their strategic plans. <br /> The National Plan also proposes to design and <br /> implement training for conference committees for <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries. For some targeted conferences, <br /> such training may be required. <br /> The National Plan also proposes to recruit, train, <br /> and deploy a core of new leaders in the development of <br /> community ministries to assist both conferences and <br /> local churches. A core group of missionaries is also proposed <br /> to help coordinate and implement the various programmatic <br /> thrusts of the National Plan, working under <br /> the guidance of the National Committee of <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministries, the entity responsible for <br /> overseeing the implementation of the National Plan. In <br /> addition to equipping conference leaders, the National <br /> Plan intends to continue recruiting, equipping, and <br /> updating consultants who assist local churches in the <br /> Congregational Mobilization Process. <br /> <b><i>Goals for 2009&ndash;2012 <br /> </b></i>Moving forward into the future, the National Plan <br /> for Hispanic/Latino Ministry affirms the following goals <br /> for the 2009&ndash;2012 quadrennium: <br /> <b>Congregational Development <br /> </b></ul><li>Charter 75 new Hispanic/Latino churches. <br /> </ul><li>Form 500 new faith communities. <br /> </ul><li>Accompany 100 congregations in the Congregational <br /> Mobilization Process to revitalize their <br /> ministries. <br /> <b>Immigration Ministry and Other <br /> Critical Social Issues <br /> </b></ul><li>Develop, test, implement, and evaluate a number <br /> of models for dealing with immigration, justice, <br /> and other critical social issues. <br /> </ul><li>Strengthen our collaboration with the Justice for <br /> Our Neighbors project in order to serve a greater <br /> number of communities addressing immigration <br /> issues. <br /> </ul><li>Create and nurture national, regional, and local <br /> partnerships and networks between local congregations <br /> and community-organizing groups or networks <br /> and other grassroots organizations and <br /> groups dealing with immigration and other critical <br /> social issues. <br /> <b>Annual Conference and Local Church <br /> Strategy <br /> </b></ul><li>Identify and train new potential transforming lay <br /> and clergy leaders for Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Enhance and develop Module III workshops and <br /> materials on new congregational development, on <br /> immigration, and other critical social issues with <br /> an emphasis on values, cultural needs, and <br /> socioeconomic realities. <br /> </ul><li>Assist a number of annual conferences to develop <br /> a strategic plan for Hispanic/Latino ministries <br /> focused on congregational development, immigration, <br /> social justice, and leadership development <br /> and accompany these conferences in the <br /> implementation and evaluation of their plans. <br /> <b>Leadership Formation Goals <br /> </b></ul><li>Develop, test, implement, and evaluate at least <br /> one alternative model to traditional seminary <br /> education for providing theological education to <br /> Hispanic/Latino pastors on the pathway to ordination. <br /> <b>Global Ministries 1047 <br /> </b></ul><li>Continue to equip lay missioners and pastormentor <br /> teams, facilitators, consultants, commissioned <br /> missionaries and other leaders and to <br /> assist them in forming a network for mutual <br /> strengthening, updating, and cross-fertilization of <br /> ideas and models for Hispanic/Latino ministries. <br /> </ul><li>Identify, train, and deploy 50 commissioned missionaries <br /> to provide leadership in <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries with special focus on <br /> congregational development, immigration and <br /> other critical social issues, and conference <br /> accompaniment and local church mobilization. <br /> </ul><li>Train and equip conference committees on <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministries, conference staff and <br /> other lay and clergy leaders of Hispanic/Latino <br /> ministries, according to the priorities of the <br /> National Plan. <br /> <b><i>Supporting Structures and Resources <br /> </i>General Agencies <br /> </b>The mission of The United Methodist Church is to <br /> make disciples of Jesus Christ to transform the world. <br /> It is a mission that calls us forward and beyond the <br /> church walls into the community, in this case, the <br /> Hispanic/Latino community. In this effort to reach all <br /> people and transform the world, the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry continues to be a ministry of <br /> the whole church. With the hard-won experience of the <br /> previous quadrennia, the National Plan believes that <br /> God is calling us to a more focused work in developing <br /> new congregations, ministry in immigration and <br /> other critical social issues, leadership formation, and <br /> working with annual conferences and local churches in <br /> strategic and transformative ways. We must press <br /> ahead in our discipleship, moving toward maturity in <br /> collaborating with God to transform the world. In the <br /> past, the representatives of the general program agencies <br /> who have worked on various elements of the <br /> National Plan in collaboration with the National <br /> Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries have shown <br /> creativity and effectiveness in this collaborative <br /> process. We are confident that, by God&rsquo;s grace, the <br /> general agencies will again show creativity and effectiveness <br /> as the National Plan moves in these new directions, <br /> together holding a vision of the church as a sign <br /> of the reign of God in the midst of the Hispanic/Latino <br /> community and our nation. <br /> Under the guidance of the National Committee on <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministries, each agency will continue <br /> to fulfill its unique responsibilities to the National Plan <br /> and to the previously mentioned strategies, as described <br /> in the following paragraphs. <br /> <b>The General Board of Church and Society will: <br /> </b></ul><li>In ongoing consultation with the National <br /> Committee on Hispanic/Latino Ministries, design <br /> and implement Module III workshops related to <br /> the systemic and structural issues affecting <br /> Hispanics/Latinos and immigration, healthcare, <br /> education, unemployment, and housing issues;

A coordinator is <br /> needed to work with all the general agencies and annual <br /> conferences of the church. We recommend that the <br /> office and coordinator continue to be located at the <br /> General Board of Global Ministries. <br /> Having done an extensive assessment of <br /> Hispanic/Latino ministry, the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry recognizes the need for ongoing <br /> assessment and research of our denomination&rsquo;s work <br /> among Hispanics/Latinos. There is a strong desire to <br /> learn from examples of successful Hispanic/Latino ministry, <br /> which need to be collected and disseminated on an <br /> ongoing basis. <br /> We recommend that the National Committee on <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministries continue to be the entity <br /> responsible for overseeing and guiding the implementation <br /> of the National Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry <br /> and that it be composed of fifteen members as follows: <br /> </ul><li>Two bishops named by the Council of Bishops, <br /> attending with funds from the Episcopal Fund; <br /> </ul><li>One representative from, and named by, MARCHA <br /> (Metodistas Asociados Representado la <br /> Causa Hispano-Americana); <br /> </ul><li>One representative from, and named by, the Rio <br /> Grande Conference; <br /> </ul><li>One elected board member from the general program <br /> boards: Church and Society, Discipleship, <br /> Global Ministries, and Higher Education and <br /> Ministry; all to be selected and funded by their <br /> respective agencies; <br /> </ul><li>Up to seven at-large members, selected by the <br /> National Committee on Hispanic/Latino <br /> Ministries to reflect the varied constituency of The <br /> United Methodist Church with regard to gender, <br /> age, lay versus clergy status, Hispanic/Latinos and <br /> non-Hispanics, with jurisdictional inclusiveness as <br /> well.

This Plan calls our church forward <br /> and beyond the church walls into the community&mdash;in <br /> this case, the Hispanic/Latino community. In this effort <br /> to reach all people and transform the world, the National <br /> Plan for Hispanic/Latino Ministry will continue to be a <br /> ministry of the whole church and await the harvest that <br /> the Lord will bring if we remain faithful to God&rsquo;s leading. <br /> <b><i>General Advance Special <br /> </b></i>We further recommend that the National Plan for <br /> Hispanic/Latino Ministry be supplemented with the <br /> renewal and continuation of the National Challenge <br /> Fund for Hispanic Ministries, a General Advance <br /> Special. The Fund&rsquo;s purpose will be to support the <br /> development of congregational and community ministries <br /> in Hispanic/Latino communities throughout the <br /> US. The General Board of Global Ministries, in collaboration <br /> with the Committee on Hispanic Ministries, <br /> shall revise the existing guidelines as needed. The <br /> General Board of Global Ministries will be responsible <br /> for the promotion of the Fund. <br /> <b><i>Footnotes <br /> </b></i>1.
