<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>259. Seek Moratorium on Capital Punishment <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, United Methodists value the sanctity of human life, and desire that no human being be executed by capital punishment; and <br> Whereas, 75 innocent persons have been released from death row due to wrongful conviction and imprisonment since 1976, according to the National Conference on Wrongful Convictions and The Death Penalty at Northwestern University Law School; and <br> Whereas, the American Bar Association has called for a moratorium on the death penalty until flaws in the criminal justice system related to capital cases are corrected, so that innocent people are not put to death; and <br> Whereas, thorough investigations and competent experienced capital case lawyers are often not appointed to defend poor defendants in capital cases; and <br> Whereas, highly publicized capital cases seem often to be decided in an emotionally charged atmosphere; and <br> Whereas, DNA evidence was not available when most current death row prisoners were convicted; and <br> Whereas, by October 1, 1998, the work of privately paid lawyers (by those who could afford them), DNA evidence, and legal corrections had exonerated 75 of the over 3,500 people currently on death row in the United States, <br> &nbsp; <i>Therefore,</i> the General Conference of The United Methodist Church calls upon the government to enact an immediate moratorium on carrying out of the death penalty sentence. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the secretary of the General Conference, the Council of Bishops, and the general secretary of the Board of Church and Society invite the governors and senators from the 50 U.S.A. states and the president, vice president, and major candidates for president of the U.S.A. to take a strong stand for this moratorium. <br> <i>Be it further resolved,</i> such a request or invitation to government officials should be made within 40 days of the end of the 2000 General Conference and should be publicized in the major newspapers around the world. <br> </i></i><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 164<i>A. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
