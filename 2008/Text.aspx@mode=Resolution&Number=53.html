Church and Community Workers <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, current social and economic needs across the U.S.A. call upon the church for attention and action in accordance with Christ&rsquo;s teachings; and <br> Whereas, financial undergirding of human service programs by the public sector on all levels has failed to meet the needs of people; and <br> Whereas, developing contacts and linkages between local church/<br> cooperative ministries and community groups is key to the understanding of and response to human hurt and need, and is a primary strength of the church and community ministry program; and <br> Whereas, for many decades church and community workers have worked effectively in mission outreach with The United Methodist Church in town and rural, urban, and specialized settings; and <br> Whereas, church and community workers are the only cadre of missionaries serving within the bounds of the U.S.A. who are employed and assigned by the General Board of Global Ministries; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that the General Board of Global Ministries continue to recruit, enlist, train, adequately fund, and deploy church and community workers, and <br> &nbsp; <i>Be it further resolved,</i> that the funding partnership continue between the local area, annual conference, and the General Board of Global Ministries in order to place church and community workers in economically depressed areas where they are desperately needed. <br> </i></i><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 1992<br> REVISED AND READOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>P</i>. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
