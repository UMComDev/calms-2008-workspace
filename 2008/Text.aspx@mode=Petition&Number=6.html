Meaning of Commissioning of a Local Pastor -- Commissioning is the act of the church that publicly acknowledges God's call and the response, talents, gifts and training of the candidate.&nbsp;&nbsp;The commissioning of a local pastor does not imply ordination.&nbsp;&nbsp;Election as a commissioned local pastor does not imply election to membership in the conference.&nbsp;&nbsp;No new rights or responsibilities are created by the act of commissioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;In commissioning, the church invokes the Holy Spirit as the candidate's source of strength to be a faithful servant leader, to lead the church in service, to proclaim the Word of God, and to equip others for ministry. <br /> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Act of Commissioning of Local Pastors -- At a public service, preferably a part of the annual conference meeting, the Bishop shall lay hands on each candidate who has been elected as a Commissioned Local Pastor and say, "[Name] I commission you a Local Pastor in The United Methodist Church, to provide servant leadership to the people of God to whom you are appointed; In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit."</b><br /></b></b></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>At present, local pastors are not officially recognized as servant leaders by any act of the church.&nbsp;&nbsp;Election as a Commissioned Local Pastor and a commissioning ceremony will eliminate this gap, without blurring the lines between Ordained Elders and Local Pastors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Election as a Commissioned Local Pastor is symbolic and...<br /></p></td>
