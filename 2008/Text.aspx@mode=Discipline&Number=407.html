<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>407.</b> <i>Assignment Process</i>-1. <i>Jurisdictional Committee on Episcopacy</i>-The jurisdictional committee on episcopacy, after consultation with the College of Bishops, shall recommend the assignment of the bishops to their respective residences for final action by the jurisdictional conference; it shall not reach any conclusion concerning residential assignments until all elections of bishops for that session are completed and all bishops have been consulted. A bishop may be recommended for assignment to the same residence for a third quadrennium only if the jurisdictional committee on episcopacy on a two-thirds vote and the jurisdictional conference by a two-thirds vote determines such assignment to be in the best interest of the jurisdiction. <br> The date of assignment for all bishops is September 1 following the jurisdictional conference.</sub><sup>2 <br> </sup></sub>A newly elected bishop shall be assigned to administer an area other than that within which his or her membership was most recently held, unless by a two-thirds vote the jurisdictional committee shall recommend that this restriction be ignored and by majority vote the jurisdictional conference shall concur.</sub><sup>3</sup></sub><br> 2. <i>Central Conference Committee on Episcopacy</i>-The central conference committee on episcopacy, after consultation with the College of Bishops, shall recommend the assignment of the bishops to their respective residences for final action by the central conference.</sub><sup>4 <br> </sup></sub>3. <i>Special Assignments</i>-The Council of Bishops may, with consent of the bishop and the concurrence of the jurisdictional or central conference committee on episcopacy, assign one of its members for one year to some specific churchwide responsibility deemed of sufficient importance to the welfare of the total Church. In this event, a bishop shall be released from the presidential responsibilities within the episcopal area for that term. Another bishop or bishops, active or retired, and not necessarily from the same jurisdictional or central conference, shall be named by the Council of Bishops on recommendation of the College of Bishops of the jurisdiction involved<br> to assume presidential responsibilities during the interim. In the event that more than one retired bishop is assigned to fulfill presidential responsibilities in one episcopal area, the Episcopal Fund shall be responsible only for the difference between the pensions paid the retired bishops and the remuneration of one active bishop. This assignment may be renewed for a second year by a two-thirds vote of the Council of Bishops and majority vote of the jurisdictional or central committee on episcopacy, and the consent of the bishop and the College of Bishops involved. The bishop so assigned shall continue to receive regular salary and support. <br> 2. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 781. <br> 3. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decisions 48, 57, 416, 538. <br> 4. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 248. <br>
