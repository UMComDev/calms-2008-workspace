<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>208. Pathways to Economic Justice <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>The church is set in a world of growing inequality. Even in the United States where there are 268 billionaires, a large percentage of all children live below the poverty line. The richest 1 percent of Americans had as much income in 1999 as the bottom 38 percent combined. In many poor countries in Africa and Asia, the poverty is deeper and the gap between rich and poor exceeds the gap that existed in life between Dives and Lazarus. In such a situation, the church must decide whether its mission to preach good news to the poor is good news only for their spiritual life or whether it is good news to the whole person. <br> From the beginnings of Methodism, we have always been a movement that sees the whole person, body and soul. Wesley&rsquo;s class meetings emphasized both acts of piety and acts of mercy. He organized and used the class meetings to support groups like sewing collectives, that helped those who didn&rsquo;t have much money, bring their resources together to start small businesses that would be a witness to God&rsquo;s abundance in the midst of poverty. The church has many opportunities to continue that witness if we make the commitment that Wesley made: every congregation not only gives to mission, but has an opportunity to use its assets for the building of a more just economy. <br> Drawing on the teachings of Jesus and the prophets, the writings and example of our founder John Wesley, and on an analysis of current economic conditions, we can discern pathways leading to a more just and equitable sharing of the riches which God has given us as a human family. These pathways are personal, local, and global.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Personal Pathways to Economic Justice <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Support locally based businesses. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Recycle waste products and avoid use of disposable products where possible. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Buy organic, locally produced foods as much as possible. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Invest personal savings in stocks and mutual funds which are socially screened. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Buy only clothing and other articles that you know are not manufactured by child labor, sweatshop, or slave labor. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Engage in Bible study on economic justice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Take part in study groups on economic issues, using materials from groups like the People of Faith Network. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Local Paths to Economic Justice <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;Support local initiatives for moderate and low income housing. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support policies of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity employment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Open your church to house the homeless and feed the hungry. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Each congregation commit a tithe (10 percent) of its budget to helping the poor and working for economic justice. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support full rights for farm workers, especially the right to organize and bargain collectively. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;National and Global Paths to Economic Justice <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>Conference United Methodist Women organizations take up at least one specific action project for economic justice in the next quadrennium. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Make every annual conference staff racially and ethnically diverse at all levels. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support the right of governments to limit the international flow of capital. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Deny Most Favored Nation Trade Status to nations which permit sweatshop, child, or slave labor, do not permit workers to organize, and do not guarantee workers a living wage by accepted international standards. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Enact campaign finance reform that prevents corporations and special interest groups buying legislators and dominating the legislative process. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support public sector job creation to build highways, schools, and housing when the private sector is unable to provide jobs for all who need them. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support policies that encourage the use of renewable resources and limit the destruction of nonrenewable resources, leading to a sustainable environment. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> End the fiction that the corporation is a &ldquo;person,&rdquo; a doctrine never envisioned by the founding fathers. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> Support Jubilee 2000 through living out its spirit and principles in the life of the community. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church has too often neglected the full call of the gospel and left economics in the hands of government and business. The kingdom of God is a form of economy that calls forth from each of us a commitment to the abundance of God in our midst. It is a call to renounce the politics of greed and acquisitiveness which dominate the institutions of government and business and reclaim their true calling in the service of people. Economy is how we order our lives, our politics, our world. It is time that we manifest gospel values in the economic order. It is after all, our calling. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, Â¶ 163<i>D </i>and<i> E.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
