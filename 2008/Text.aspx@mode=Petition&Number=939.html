General Commission on the Role and Status of Women, the Judicial Council, and the 2012 General Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondarily, if any of the cases were egregious in their handling, the panel shall recommend actions to the appropriate Annual Conferences that could make those situations "whole." <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expenses for the panel shall be covered by General Council on Finance and Administration, but the expenses related to those bringing their cases shall be covered by those people, their advocates, and/or their family seeking relief. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hearings of the panel shall be held in all five United States Jurisdictions in places as central in those areas as possible. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>I have seen good pastors destroyed by cruel, thoughtless, and incompetent handling of complaints over the last quarter century.&nbsp;&nbsp;The procedures used have been unfair.&nbsp;&nbsp;The judging bodies have largely been more interested in supporting the position of the bishop than they were in finding justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Even the Judicial Council...<br /></p></td>
