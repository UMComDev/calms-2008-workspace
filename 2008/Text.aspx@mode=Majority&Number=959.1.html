Most people do not regard their siblings as &ldquo;extended&rdquo; family members</strike> . <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strike> And whereas, &ldquo;Chain migration&rdquo; is a myth. <br /> This concept purports that immigrants sponsor an uncontrollable number of family members.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, only immigrants who have already gained legal permanent residency or U.S. citizenship can sponsor relatives.&nbsp;&nbsp;On average, they only sponsor an average of 1.2 family members. <br /> </strike> <br /> <strike> And Whereas, Point systems that hurt families would also hurt the economy. <br /> A point system would not improve employment-based immigration, but would instead result in an influx of degree holders that would compete for jobs currently held by middle-class Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of these highly skilled workers may refuse to work in the United States, given such restrictions on family unity.&nbsp;&nbsp;To improve the admission of highly skilled workers, caps should be increased, which can be done easily without disturbing the healthy balance of family immigration</strike> . <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Let it be resolved that the General Conference is in support of just and fair immigration policies that benefit and allow the family to preserve and maintain its unity.</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /></td>
