<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>84. Keep Children Free of Drugs and Alcohol <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>Whereas, our Christian faith calls us to teach and lead children in the right way; and <br> Whereas, over a third of children begin using alcohol before they are teens; and <br> Whereas, one in ten young teens is a regular user of marijuana and other drugs; and <br> Whereas, alcohol and drugs bring harm to growing bodies and minds; and <br> Whereas, it is illegal in most states to sell or give alcoholic beverages to those under 21 and illicit use and selling of &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; drugs is a crime at any age; and <br> Whereas, the Justice Department reports that many school programs aimed to help young people have not deterred their use of alcohol and other drugs; and <br> Whereas, young people with inner stamina, self-esteem, and faith more readily can say, &ldquo;no&rdquo; to drugs and alcohol; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved,</i> that we, the 2000 General Conference of The United Methodist Church, support efforts to keep children drug free and safe that young people can have full lives, avoiding use of beverage alcohol and illicit drugs and say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to them. <br> 1. We call upon individual families to pray for their children and to teach their children by precept and example the preference of avoiding beverage alcohol and illicit drugs and resisting peer pressures for their use. <br> 2. We call upon all people to pray and give moral and financial support to community, church and other efforts to discourage children and teens from use of alcohol and drugs. <br> 3. We call upon our local congregations to pray for the children and to include in their Christian education programs for young people and their families studies emphasizing the ill effects of drugs and alcohol and the importance of avoidance of them. <br> 4. We further call upon local congregations to have annual observances of a Drug and Alcohol Awareness Sunday and to challenge young people and their elders to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; as an aspect of their commitment to Jesus Christ. <br> 5. We call upon our fellow citizens to support legislation that will help to curtail availability of alcoholic beverages to youth and to support public programs that help to instill values in young people that will help them to have drug-and-alcohol-free lives. <br> 6. We call upon other religious bodies to join us in adopting resolutions and supporting efforts to curtail alcohol and drug abuse in our communities, states, and nation. <br> 7. We direct the General Board of Church and Society and the General Board of Discipleship to develop and promote resource materials to implement this concern within the connection. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See<b></i> </b>Social Principles, Â¶ 162<i>J. <br> </i></i>&nbsp; </i>
