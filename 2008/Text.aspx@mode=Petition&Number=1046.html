The number to be elected shall correspond to the number of members whose terms expire at the conclusion of such session. Each of the jurisdictions and the central conferences as a group shall be represented by at least one nominee, but it shall not be a requirement that each of the jurisdictions or the central conferences as a group be represented by an elected member. <strike> At</strike>&nbsp; <b>Within twenty-four hours of </b>the <strike> same</strike>&nbsp;daily session at which the above nominations are announced, nominations of both ministers and laypersons may be made from the floor <strike> , but at no other time</strike>&nbsp; <b>by submitting a petition signed by at least twenty delegates to the General Conference in a manner prescribed by the rules of the General Conference. The name of each person nominated from the floor shall be published in <i>Daily Christian Advocate</i> along with the names and annual conferences of all the delegates signing their nominating petition. Candidates may not be nominated in any other way.</b><br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The names of all nominees, identified with the conference to which each belongs, and a biographical sketch that does not exceed one hundred words shall be published by the <i>Daily Christian Advocate</i> at least forty-eight hours prior to the time of election, which shall be set by action of the General Conference at the session at which the nominations are made; and from these nominations the General Conference shall elect without discussion, by ballot and majority vote, the necessary number of ministerial and lay members. <br /> <br /> This legislation becomes effective upon adoption. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>This would make the process of nominating candidates for the Judicial Council similar to the process for placing a minority report before the General Conference. It would provide the General Conference with more information about who was nominating a candidate. <br /> <br /></p></td>
