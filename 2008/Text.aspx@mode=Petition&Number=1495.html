Mental illness surely affects comparable numbers of United Methodists, including our pastoral leadership and their families, not only in the United States but globally.&nbsp;&nbsp;When impacted, families are included,&nbsp;thus&nbsp; mental illness directly or indirectly affects most United Methodists.&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective congregational ministry of inclusion and support to persons with a mental illness diagnosis and their families is a critical test of our ability to function in ways that are consistent with Biblical teachings.&nbsp;&nbsp;"...effective care for people with enduring mental health problems is not an option for the church, but is in fact a fundamental mark of its identity and a vital indication of its continuing faithfulness."&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, neglecting such ministry has a deep and painful impact on these persons and their families and upon the church&rsquo;s witness worldwide.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Starting in 1996, successive United Methodist General Conferences have by resolution commended to congregations the Caring Communities program in which congregations covenant to educate themselves about mental illness, welcome and support those persons with mental illness and their families, and advocate on behalf of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;By so doing, congregations affirm God&rsquo;s present work of healing (John 5:17), affirm God&rsquo;s presence in the least of these (Matthew 25:26), and reach out to incorporate every part of the Body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:12).&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> This affirmation of inclusion and support is clearly not optional, but an integral part of the ministry of each United Methodist congregation and annual conferences around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore to further this important work, the General Conference hereby commits resources to promote and extend this work of evangelism and social justice through the <i>Caring Communities Education Initiative</i>. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Unlike many disabilities, mental illness is often &ldquo;invisible&rdquo; in congregations.&nbsp;&nbsp;It has no physical signs, stigmatization induces&nbsp;persons to &ldquo;suffer in silence&rdquo;, and the suffering is thus more likely to continue unaddressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it is important for the <i>Caring Communities Education Initiative</i> to focus on mental illness in particular rather than all disabilities in general, in order to maintain its focus on the unique issues facing those with mental illness and their families.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the results of this initiative on congregational life are expected to advance other efforts of inclusion and support for persons with disabilities and their families, including deaf ministries. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The <i>Caring Communities Education Initiative</i> will consist of&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; empowerment of the <u>United Methodist Mental Illness Network (UMMIN),</u> comprised of representatives of Annual Conference mental illness ministries; through an Advisory Committee;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; advocacy for Mental Illness Ministry Directors and Coordinators in each Annual Conference; <br /> (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordination of UMMIN with mental illness work with the various general agencies and boards of the denomination,&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; assembly of a Convocation of Annual Conference leaders for planning, coordination and training, and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the training and dispatch of Education Teams to congregations and conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> (6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a special focus on Clergy Mental Illness. <br /> (7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; accountability to the General Board of Church and Society <br /> (8)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Funding authorized by the General Conference and administered by the General Board of Church and Society. <br /> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Because travel costs will be minimized and extensive use of electronic communication employed, this initiative will include United Methodists globally.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;United Methodist Mental Illness Network <br /> <br /> </b>The United Methodist Mental Illness Network (UMMIN) was established by the GBCS in 1996 in response to a 1992 General Conference mandate&nbsp;(1992 Book of Resolutions p.317, f.),&nbsp; thereby reflecting almost two decades&rsquo; effort to promote ministry to persons with mental illness and their families as a part of each congregation&rsquo;s ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, UMMIN was comprised of lay and clergy members representing 15 states, 18 annual conferences, and every jurisdiction in the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;UMMIN is committed to enhancing the skills of United Methodist congregations in mental illness ministry that is seeking to bring persons living with a diagnosis of mental illness into full participation in the life of the United Methodist Church. UMMIN is committed to reaching local United Methodist congregations have not had the opportunity to fully embrace the concept of creating &ldquo;Caring Communities&rdquo; in their local ministries as called for by past General Conferences.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Under the Caring Communities Education Initiative, the UMMIN will be expanded to include Annual Conference-designated mental illness ministry coordinators or directors, and from the UMMIN members an Advisory Committee will be selected to guide efforts under the initiative. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;Advisory Committee <br /> </b></b><br /> </b>UMMIN will elect an Advisory Committee to advise staff of the General Board of Church and Society in implementing this Initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the Advisory Committee will be determined as needs and resources allow.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committee will identify its own officers; establish quadrennial goals for the general church, annual conferences; and local congregations consistent with this resolution and schedule activities of the Initiative.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Advisory Committee will: <br />1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; identify and promote ways to expand UMMIN&nbsp;&nbsp;within the United Methodist Church&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; promote and guide educational efforts related to Initiative goals&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; appoint individual UMMIN members to task<strike>s</strike>&nbsp; forces in keeping with their interests, gifts, and abilities and the needs of the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate online dialogue groups can be established for each task force as well as for&nbsp;UMMIN as a whole. <br /> 4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structure tasks within the network to maximize use of individual gifts and time and to sustain participation in online groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; make every effort to utilize modern technology, such as both live and asynchronous internet conferencing groups in order to conserve energy, minimize travel, conference, and hotel expenses, and save time and dollars. <br /> 6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Publish an online newsletter or articles in other publications to publicize the Initiative, as appropriate.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Resource Ministry <br /> </b></b></b><br /> UMMIN will gather and disseminate a comprehensive list of resources related to mental illness ministry, which can give support to pastors &ldquo;<i>to build the body of Christ as a caring and giving community, extending the ministry of Christ to the world</i>.&rdquo; <i>&ldquo;to order the life of the Church for mission and ministry...and by leading the Church in obedience to mission in the world&rdquo;</i> in ministries which welcome people with and mental illnesses as they become available.&nbsp;&nbsp;Gathering and disseminating resources may be extended to include seminary training and/ or online clergy development training for new clergy, and e-mail discussion, as appropriate, with established clergy and other ministry personnel including mental health coordinators, mental health chaplains, mental health professionals, parish nurses, youth pastors, and Pastoral Counselors.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <b> c.&nbsp;&nbsp;Models of Ministry <br /> <br /> </b>UMMIN will identify throughout the United Methodist Church congregations currently involved in mental illness ministry and will create an online database of models of ministry for other congregations to replicate.&nbsp;&nbsp;UMMIN will call for unpublished papers, congregational and personal stories about mental illness and ministries to persons with a mental illness to be provided for its educational purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;Mental Illness Ministry Directors and Coordinators <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>This General Conference recommends that every annual conference of this global denomination appoint a Coordinator (volunteer) or Director (paid staff) of Mental Health Ministries tasked to support congregations of the Annual Conference in becoming fully inclusive communities empowering persons with mental illness and their families to live, work, worship, and pray alongside others.&nbsp;&nbsp;While annual conferences around the world have widely varying resources, and some may be able to fund a paid Director, all annual conferences are able to designate a volunteer. When United Methodist clergy are appointed to the role of Director, we recommend that this role be funded for at least one-quarter time.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Coordinator or Director will assist congregations in de-stigmatizing persons with these no-fault illnesses in ways that are consistent with Biblical teachings.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Conference encourages Jurisdictions and Central Conferences to seek out resources to fund a budget for materials and travel to support the work of Mental Illness Ministry Directors and Coordinators in their efforts to extend the vision of inclusion to local congregations.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Conference commends all those who generously and sacrificially currently serve in these roles with limited resources <br /> <b> 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Coordination with General Agencies and Boards <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Many general agencies and boards&nbsp; of our church have responsibilities related to mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the summer of 2006 there were more than 580 references to mental illness on the website of the General Board of Discipleship alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;Stewardship of limited denominational resources dictates that every effort be made to avoid duplication, but to use most effectively the efforts and responsibilities of each agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;At the start of the Quadrennium, the Advisory Committee will convene a meeting of representatives from each general agency and other denominational boards with responsibilities related to mental illness. <br /></li></li></li><li>Those present will describe their mandates and ministries related to mental illness and how their respective roles can support congregational efforts to become Caring Communities. <br /> <ul><li>The discussion will be recorded and disseminated as appropriate to seminaries or others in the church at large with an interest in education about the Church&rsquo;s mission and ministry. </li></li><br /><li>The discussion will develop joint objectives and coordination of efforts with each other and UMMIN Coordination will continue electronically.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b> </li></li></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 4.&nbsp;&nbsp;Convocation <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>During the third year of the quadrennium, UMMIN will convene a face-to-face meeting of United Methodist leaders in Mental Illness Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp; Attendees of the Convocation will be as broadly representative a group of United Methodist leaders in mental illness as funding will allow, with an emphasis on those who may be most helpful in assisting congregations to become Caring Communities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attendees will include, to the extent possible, all members of UMMIN, whose electronic interaction will be strengthened by this face-to-face contact.&nbsp;&nbsp;Research by those involved in long-distance learning and collaboration via technology and media shows that much may be accomplished through electronic communication and meeting, however, initial face-to-face contact is a key element in assuring group cohesion and productivity.&nbsp; &nbsp; Speakers at the Convocation will include appropriate representatives of the mental illness ministry work of United Methodist boards, Agencies, annual conferences, districts, congregations and other groups, as well as outside speakers. <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<b><br /> </b></b></ul></ul></ul></ul></b>Objectives of the UMMIN Convocation on Mental Health Ministries will include: <br /></li></li></li><li>education about the Caring Community program for local congregations, its purpose, its need, and means to implement it. Training shall include UM Communications staff in Nashville to assist congregations calling about program resources for mental illness ministries.<br /> </li></li></li><li>establishment of face to face contact to facilitate future working relationships<br /> <ul><li>expansion of the UMMIN leadership base to facilitate greater outreach to congregations. </li></li><br /><li>reporting by the Advisory Committee of UMMIN&rsquo;s progress to date </li></li><br /><li>provision of input by Convocation attendees to Advisory Committee leadership regarding appropriate tasks and their prioritization.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tasks may include: <br /> </li></li></li></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The creation of a &ldquo;theology of mental illness and of mental illness ministry&rdquo; based on biblical teachings of inclusiveness, liberation, and hope and the local church&rsquo;s mission through consultation with theologians, mental health chaplains, mental health professionals, and social service professionals, psychiatric, and other professional groups to be identified. <br /> 2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Discussion of the biblical, ethical, and social implications of the lack of ministry to persons with mental illnesses and their families which continues in the church as a whole;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> 3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Development of a plan for the educational component of this petition including the continuing collaboration with general boards and agencies, annual conferences, districts, local congregations, and groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Convocation will include both plenary and smaller working groups, and will include Bible Studies, preaching and worship workshops.&nbsp;&nbsp;Consultants will present from a variety of disciplines, including theology, homiletics, and pastoral care, to inspire participants spiritually and infuse them with new ideas and challenges. <br /> </ul></ul></ul></ul><b> 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;Education Teams <br /> </b><br /> Education Teams will take the work done by the Advisory Committee, including research and the convocation, and make it useful to annual conferences and other church leadership in helping local congregations to become Caring Congregations. Education Teams will conduct small training seminars, on line as much as possible; to anticipate and address questions and problems congregations may face in becoming Caring Congregations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> <b><br /> </b></b></b>Education Teams will be comprised of staff and other leadership from UMMIN, the general agencies and boards, annual conferences, District Superintendents, pastoral counselors, parish nurses, mental health chaplains, mental health professionals, mental health coordinators, Christian educators, youth ministers, and other individuals and groups with a commitment to congregations becoming Caring Communities. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> In their training, Education Teams will be exposed to United Methodist professionals and consultants from a variety of disciplines including theology, homiletics, pastoral care, disability, and mental health as well as mental illness advocacy groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;Training will be intended both to inspire participants spiritually and to infuse them with new ideas and challenges.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Education Teams will create standards for mental health ministry for local churches and annual conferences prior to the Matching Grants phase of the petition.&nbsp;&nbsp;These standards shall be similar to the 26 <u><i>Guidelines </u></i> handbooks developed by the General Board of Discipleship for local church work area training and will also be available in downloadable pdf&rsquo;s.&nbsp;&nbsp;Education teams will&nbsp;&nbsp;<strike>and</strike>&nbsp;also develop new models where needs exist and no model is available to address that need.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Education teams will respond to requests from congregations, annual conferences, and groups at all levels of the Church who are willing to dialogue and/ or problem solve about mental illness ministry issues. An e-mail "hotline" for Info-Serv (United Methodist Information Services) and other UM Communications staff in Nashville to reach our Education Teams will be offered to help them better assist congregations calling about mental illness ministry issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Board of Church & Society Mental Illness Network will also assemble lists of resources and contacts helpful to local congregations that the General Board of Church & Society can supply to Info-Serv (United Methodist Information Services) in Nashville.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Training of Education Teams will include the creation of audio-visual resource kits, notebooks, and how-to guides for use in directly impacting persons and congregations regarding mental illness ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Separate &ldquo;training packages&rdquo; may be created so as to address the different needs of large, medium and small congregations, multi, small, and no staff congregations, and urban and rural congregations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Special attention will be given to resources for rural congregations where mental health services are scarce.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some training participants may be able to experience existing training programs such as Befriended Ministry in St. Paul, MN and refer other congregations to this model as finances allow. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Education Teams are mandated during the 2009-2012 quadrennium to present at meetings of the College of Bishops, affected general agencies and boards, seminaries, and annual conferences, who are asked to provide the necessary times on their agendas to accomplish this.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The Caring Communities Education Teams will contact church leadership at a variety of levels to provide information on Caring Communities and to coordinate deployment of the teams. <br /> <br /> <b> 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Clergy Mental Illness <br /> </b><br /> Mental illness, a no-fault illness, occurs among United Methodist clergy and clergy families just as it occurs among all people.&nbsp;&nbsp;The presence of mental illness in clergy and clergy families, however, exposes church decision-makers, from Staff Parish Relations Committees to Conference Cabinets, to conflicts between the provision of compassionate support and the need to ensure that the work of ministry entrusted to clergy is accomplished.&nbsp;&nbsp;The UMMIN Advisory Committee will convene a Clergy and Mental Illness Task Force including representatives from the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, the Council of Bishops, and a representative annual conference Board of Ordained Ministry and Cabinet member.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force will review current practice in addressing circumstances where a congregation&rsquo;s pastor or family member has a mental illness.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Task Force will prepare recommendations to Conference Cabinets and Boards of Ordained Ministry, as well as congregational Staff-Pastor Relations Committees, on appropriate means for supporting clergy families in such situations.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accountability <br /> </b><br /> UMMIN and its Advisory Committee will continue to be accountable to the General Board of Church and Society.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Advisory Committee will work with GBCS to plan all face-to-face meetings of working groups.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;Funding <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b>Funding to support the work of the Caring Communities Initiative as described above is being sought through a separate petition. <br /> <CENTER><b><br /> Budget and Justification for&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <i>Caring Communities Education Initiative&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> </b></b></CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER></i>Budget <br /> </CENTER>&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /> </ul></ul></ul></ul>We request that the General Conference provide the following resources in support of the Caring Communities Initiative, which are necessary to allow the United Methodist Mental Illness Network to meet, create an Advisory Committee, collaboration with other boards, Agencies, Task Forces&nbsp;and groups of the United Methodist Church, sponsor a Convocation on Mental Illness Ministries, and support local congregation efforts to become Caring Communities during the 2009-2012 quadrennium.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<CENTER><b><br /> <br /><table BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="0" WIDTH="590" bordercolorlight="#000000" bordercolordark="#000000" bordercolor="#000000"><tr><td></b></b></CENTER></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp;&nbsp;

Virginia Interfaith Committee on Mental Illness Ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;Matching Grants can help annual conferences in the United States and around the world establish Directors of Mental Health Ministries (paid) and Coordinators of Mental Health Ministries (volunteer). <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Ten matching grants of $4,000 each ($40,000 total cost over 2 years) will be given to an annual conference, district, or multi-staff local church &ndash; if that entity is able to (1) match that grant and provide ½ of a salary for a ¼ time paid Director of Mental Health Ministries appropriate to their ministerial setting and (2) a budget appropriate for that work in that setting during 2011 the third year of this project.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> The grant application will be submitted to the GBCS, reviewed by the Advisory committee and the final selection approved by the GBCS Board. <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Twenty matching grants of<b> </b>$1000 each ($20,000 total cost over 2 years) will be given to any annual conference or applicant who is able to secure a Volunteer Mental Health Coordinator position budget of $!,000 or more, in matching funds for that grant for a total budget of <strike> a</strike>&nbsp;$2,000 or more <strike> budget</strike>&nbsp;for the annual conference or applicant and submits the best plan for an educational program for creating a mental health ministry program with &ldquo;Caring Congregations&rdquo; where one did not exist before.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> Total cost to this proposal of these 20 matching grants would be approximately $60,000 for 1 or 2 years depending on the number of applications.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <b>Use of Technology to Extend Efforts <br /> </b></b></b><br /> Modern electronic technology can be very helpful in avoiding the need for extensive travel and face to face meetings, thereby conserving time and energy, and this budget saves costs by assuming the employment of such technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attention is called, however, to the likelihood that rural areas of the United States, and significant portions of the globe, do not yet have sufficient access to such technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;Creative measures may be required to assist leaders in such areas to participate in the educational and leadership opportunities outlined here.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <br /></p></td>
