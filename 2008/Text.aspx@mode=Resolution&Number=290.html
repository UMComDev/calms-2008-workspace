<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>290. Ending the Colonial Status of Puerto Rico <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>We direct the secretary of the General Conference of The United Methodist Church to send a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States and to all members of Congress. <br> The Christian tradition has stood clearly against colonialism, believing instead in God&rsquo;s promise of human liberation, found again and again in the Bible. God breaks the bars of the yoke of oppression and feeds the people with justice (Ezekiel 34:27-30). Moses led the Hebrew people out of Egypt to the promised land, and the Hebrew prophets call us to a world in which all people are secure in their own land and on their own mountains (Ezekiel 36:8-15; Amos 9:14-15). In the synagogue, our savior proclaimed the acceptable year of the Lord (Luke 4:16-19). Jesus calls us to be peacemakers, and to seek justice and peace with one other (Matthew 5:1-12). <br> We, in The United Methodist Church, need to be part of the struggle against colonialism, dependence, and discrimination. Puerto Ricans have resisted, for more than one hundred years, being assimilated into the American &ldquo;melting pot&rdquo; because they are proud of their culture, their language, and their heritage. They are proud of their national identity. The God of Israel, who saw, heard, and descended to liberate God&rsquo;s people from oppression in Egypt (Exodus 3:16-18; Isaiah 49:24-26) is calling upon us to acknowledge the colonial status of Puerto Rico and to advocate strongly for a decolonization and self determination process following international law and U.N. guidelines. <br> <CENTER><i>Puerto Rico&rsquo;s Colonial Experience <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The control of the political life of Puerto Rico (a &ldquo;U.S. territory&rdquo;) has never been in the hands of the Puerto Rican government, nor the Puerto Rican people, but in the hands of the U.S. Congress. To put it more bluntly, Puerto Rico has never ceased to be a colony of the U.S. <br> At the end of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the island and the people of Puerto Rico were given to the United States government as war booty. This was the direct result of the Treaty of Paris, a peace agreement signed in Paris on December 10, 1898 between the Spanish government and the United States. <br> Under the 1917 Jones Act, the United States imposed American citizenship over all citizens of Puerto Rico, making them eligible for the draft and forcing Puerto Ricans to serve in U.S. wars. When the U.S. Congress approved the current political definition of the island in Public Law 447 on July 7, 1952, Puerto Rico became the &ldquo;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,&rdquo; recently redefined by Congress as a territory not incorporated of the USA. Although this measure was meant to end the colonial status of Puerto Rico, it in fact enabled the U.S. to adopt the Constitution of Puerto Rico, which had to be approved and framed by the Constitution of the U.S. <br> In a recent case before the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals (<i>U.S. vs. Sanchez, </i>992F2d 1143, June 4, 1994), the court concluded that Puerto Rico remains a territory of the United States of America. The court sustained that Congress has the power to unilaterally revoke or derogate the Constitution of Puerto Rico and the statutes that regulate the relationship between the U.S. and its territory. And, more recently, the subcommittee on Indian and Insular Affairs of the House of Representatives rejected the inclusion of the current political status of Puerto Rico in a new referendum for considering that the current formula is &ldquo;clearly colonial,&rdquo; the same formula Congress adopted in 1952. <br> Even former U.S. President George Bush admitted that the Puerto Rican people have never been consulted as equals on their political status. In pursuit of President Bush&rsquo;s idea, Congressman Don Young (R-AL) introduced the &ldquo;United States-Puerto Rico Political Status Act&rdquo; (H.R. 3024), which was passed by the House of Representatives on March 1998. The supporters of this bill affirmed that: &ldquo;for the first time since the Treaty of Paris entered into force&rdquo; Puerto Ricans will freely express their wishes regarding their political status. Therefore, they were acknowledging that Puerto Rico is still a colony today under congressional rule. <br> In July of 1999, the governor of Puerto Rico, the Honorable Pedro Rosello (a pro-statehood advocate), asked the UN Committee on Decolonization to urge the United States to solve the colonial status of Puerto Rico. He argued that the U.S. has the moral and international obligation of solving the colonial status of Puerto Rico. <br> <CENTER><i>Why Won&rsquo;t the U.S. Let Puerto Rico Go? <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The United States maintains control over Puerto Rico for military and economic reasons. During the 1898 Spanish American War, Puerto Rico was acquired as one of the &ldquo;militarily strategic&rdquo; areas of the Pacific, Central America, and the Caribbean-along with Panama, Cuba (Guantanamo), and others. Captain Alfred T. Mahan, U.S. Naval Strategic Adviser, argued that acquiring Puerto Rico would guarantee the United States&rsquo; safety from enemy countries: &ldquo;. . . [I]t would be very difficult for a transatlantic state to maintain operations in the western Caribbean with a United States fleet based upon Puerto Rico and the adjacent islands.&rdquo; Clearly, military necessity was determined by the ideology of &ldquo;Manifest Destiny,&rdquo; dressed up in religious symbolism. Today, the U.S. controls and uses thousands of acres of Puerto Rican land for military bases (about 10 percent of Puerto Rico&rsquo;s national territory). <br> Puerto Rico has also remained under U.S. domination for political and economic reasons. After the invasion of the island, Philip C. Hana, the last U.S. consul in Puerto Rico, stated clearly, &ldquo;The trade of Puerto Rico is of more value to the United States than is the trade of many of the South and Central American countries.&rdquo; The above strategy offered the U.S. economy the possibility of an ample market for a growing capitalist economy. What Puerto Rico had to offer to the United States politically, militarily, and economically, was of too great value to let it pass. As President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, on March 1898, to his good friend, Senator Henry Cabot Lodge: &ldquo;Do not make peace until we get Puerto Rico. . . .&rdquo; One can clearly see that this clashes dramatically with General Miles&rsquo; promise of liberty and equality, a promise suggested in the first official proclamation presented once he was in control of the island. <br> Today, the U.S. continues to control the island&rsquo;s political and economic policies, leaving the people vulnerable to policies that adversely affect them. As a result, unemployment is disproportionately higher in Puerto Rico than any state of the union (between 10 to 15 percent higher than any state of the union). Puerto Rico is completely dependent on the U.S. economy. It does not have the right (as other nations around the world) to trade with other nations without the consent of the U.S. <br> Puerto Ricans have to abide by laws and rules that are established by a Congress where they have but one representative who cannot vote, so that the island&rsquo;s destiny and future are in the hands of people for whom Puerto Ricans are just a problem. <br> <CENTER><i>A Call to Action <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>All of the island&rsquo;s political parties, in recent years, have expressed their dissatisfaction with Puerto Rico&rsquo;s political status. However, those Puerto Ricans that struggled for the independence of Puerto Rico have been victims of discrimination, persecution, and imprisonment. The injustices suffered under Puerto Rico&rsquo;s colonial reality cannot be overlooked. The U.N. has clearly established that colonialism is a crime, and recognizes a colonized people&rsquo;s right to end colonialism. The United Nations&rsquo; Decolonization Committee has approved resolutions recognizing the inalienable right of the people of Puerto Rico to independence and self-determination. <br> At their 1998 meeting this committee adopted a resolution requesting that steps be taken by the U.S. in order to solve the case of Puerto Rico in accordance with the General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV). This resolution requires that for self-determination to take place colonial rule has to cease and political and economic powers be returned to the country under colonial domination. <br> The United Methodist Church has long stood for an end to colonialism and for the self-determination of all peoples. &ldquo;We affirm the right and duty of people of all nations to determine their destiny&rdquo; (Social Principles ¶ 165<i>B</i>). We have categorically opposed interventions by more powerful nations against weaker ones. Such actions violate our Social Principles and are contrary to the United Nations Charter and international laws and treaties. As a result of these historical positions, the General Conference asks that United Methodists advocate before the President of the U.S. and Congress for the people of Puerto Rico to be accorded full opportunity for true self determination in accordance with the General Assembly Resolution 1514 (XV), and in accordance with the United Nations Charter, and international laws and treaties. <br> <p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 165<i>A, B,</i> and <i>D.</i><br> </i></i>&nbsp;
