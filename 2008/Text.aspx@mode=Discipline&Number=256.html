<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶ <b>256.</b> <i>Program Ministries</i>-The ministries of the local church are offered so that people encounter God&rsquo;s redeeming love for the world and respond by participating in God&rsquo;s action in the world. To achieve this ministry, people need to be involved in a variety of small-group settings. Some will be formed by the church council. Others will emerge with the approval of this body. Another type is historical, expressing itself in organizational structures that are related to<br> counterparts in annual conferences and the general Church. These<br> are referred to as <b>program ministries</b> and are related to the church council. <br> 1. <i>The Church School and Small-Group Ministries</i>-In each local church there shall be a variety of small-group ministries, including the church school, for supporting the formation of Christian disciples focused on the transformation of the world. These small groups may concentrate on teaching and learning, fellowship, support, community ministries, and accountability. Members of small groups will build their knowledge of the Bible, the Christian faith, The United Methodist Church, and the societal context in which the church finds itself. In addition, small groups, including the church school, shall provide people with opportunities for practicing skills for faithful discipleship, including but not limited to worship, faith sharing, the creation of new faith communities, spiritual discernment, Bible study, theological reflection, prayer, community building, service with the poor and marginalized, and advocacy for peace and justice. Local churches or charges are encouraged to develop a policy to provide for the safety of the infants, children, and youth entrusted to their care. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a) The Church School</i>-In each local church there shall be a <b>church school</b> for the purpose of accomplishing the church&rsquo;s educational ministry. <br> The church school is challenged to create communities in which people of all ages experience God&rsquo;s active presence in their lives; foster healthy, nonviolent relationships within the congregation and community; testify to the reconciling love of God through Christ; and live out their faith in the world as witnesses to the coming reign of God. <br> <i>b)</i> <i>Accountable Discipleship</i>-Historically class leaders provided lay pastoral leadership, and classes and class meetings were the basic structural means of Christian spiritual formation in the early Methodist societies. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Class leaders may be commissioned and classes may be organized within the local congregation for the purpose of forming persons as faithful disciples of Jesus Christ through mutual accountability and support for witnessing to him in the world and for following his teachings through acts of compassion, justice, worship, and devotion under the guidance of the Holy Spirit. (See ¶ 103, &ldquo;The Nature, Design, and General Rules of Our United Societies&rdquo; [page 72], and<br>¶ 1118.) <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>c)</i> <i>Mission and Ministry Groups</i>-Christian discipleship is patterned after the servanthood of Jesus, who cared for the sick, fed the hungry, and befriended the outcast. People may participate in small groups in order to serve the needs of the poor and marginalized, advocate for social justice, and demonstrate their faith in all their relationships and whatever setting they find themselves in. <br> <i>d)</i> <i>Support Groups</i>-Where needed, the local church may organize small groups to support particular needs of congregation and community members, including but not limited to care and prayer groups, divorce recovery, grief recovery, parenting groups, and support for people who are suffering from chronic illness, including persons with mental illnesses and their families. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;2. <i>Children&rsquo;s Ministries</i>-Children&rsquo;s ministries-for, with, and by children-include all ministries involving children within the life of the congregational community, including but not limited to Sunday school, vacation Bible school, nursery ministries, children&rsquo;s choir and music ministries, fellowship groups, support groups, short-term study groups, children&rsquo;s worship experiences, mission education experiences, intergenerational activities, and all weekday programs for children of all ages. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> If there is a coordinator of children&rsquo;s ministries, the coordinator shall be responsible for assuring that children are considered and included within the life of the congregation. The coordinator will lead the children&rsquo;s council, when organized, and will work closely with clergy and other program-related staff. The coordinator will vision, plan, and advocate for children, particularly in the areas of faith development, safety, and discipleship. The coordinator will work with other leaders in the congregation to assure that policies and procedures are in place to help keep all children and the adults who care for and work with them safe. These policies and procedures include such things as background checks, having at least two adults per group, and cardiopulmonary resuscitation and first-aid training. The coordinator will also advocate for mission education for children, including The United Methodist Children&rsquo;s Fund for Christian Mission. <br> <i>b)</i> If there is a children&rsquo;s council, it shall be responsible for planning, visioning, and advocating for children within the congregation, the community, and the world. The council will set policies and procedures related to children, oversee the planning of short-term experiences, consider children&rsquo;s ministry needs within the whole<br> of the congregation&rsquo;s ministries, and communicate with parents and the congregation. The children&rsquo;s council will work closely with the coordinator of children&rsquo;s ministries and church staff responsible for ministry with children, including children&rsquo;s choirs and weekday<br> ministries. The children&rsquo;s council is accountable to the group responsible for the local church&rsquo;s educational ministry.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> <i>c)</i> <i>Weekday Ministry Board</i>-The term <i>weekday ministry </i>applies to any regularly planned ministry for children. When appropriate, one or more weekday ministry boards may be organized to oversee the weekday ministry programs of the congregation. The board&rsquo;s membership should be mostly professing members of the congregation, with parent, church staff, and weekday ministry staff representatives. The board will set policies consistent with the congregation&rsquo;s policies, state mandates, and sound business practices. The board will guide weekday ministries as appropriate opportunities for faith development, mission outreach, Christian education, evangelism, and safety. They will advocate for inclusion of children from various socioeconomic, cultural, and racial/ethnic backgrounds. Weekday ministry board(s) accountability should be placed within the local church organizational structure with consideration to the group responsible for the congregation&rsquo;s education ministry. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;3. <i>Young People&rsquo;s Ministries</i>-The term <i>young people</i> is inclusive of all persons from approximately twelve through thirty years of age. The term encompasses both youth and young-adult ministries and allows for age flexibility given the different age definitions for young people in various cultures around the world. The term <i>youth ministry</i> is an inclusive title, encompassing all the concerns of the Church and all activities by, with, and for youth. The youth ministry of The United Methodist Church shall include all persons from approximately twelve through eighteen years of age (generally persons in the seventh grade through the twelfth grade, taking into account the grouping of youth in the public schools), who are currently or potentially associated with the church or any of its activities. Youth who are professing members of the church have all rights and responsibilities of church membership except voting on matters prohibited by state law (<i>see</i> ¶ 226.5).

The young-adult ministry of The United Methodist Church shall<b> </b>include all persons from approximately eighteen to thirty who are currently or potentially associated with the church or any of its activities. Young<b> </b>adults who are professing members of the church have all rights and responsibilities of church membership. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>a)</i> The <b>coordinator of youth ministries and the youth council,</b> when organized, shall be responsible for recommending to the church council activities, program emphases, and settings for youth.
