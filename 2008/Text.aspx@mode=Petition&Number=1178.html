George Kevorkian, Assistant to that denomination&rsquo;s leader, Metropolitan Philip Saliba, cited that NCC fundraising letter as &ldquo;the straw that broke the camel&rsquo;s back,&rdquo; and explained that &ldquo;this does not represent a signal that we will be withdrawing from ecumenical groups,&rdquo; but rather that this would enable them to better focus their &ldquo;limited energy and resources ... on groups and activities that are more aligned with the primary mission, which is spreading the word of Jesus Christ&rdquo;; and <br /> WHEREAS, our denomination&rsquo;s General Commission on Christian Unity and Interreligious Concerns (GCCUIC) responded to this development by sending a letter to then-NCC President Thomas Hoyt and to the Antiochian Archdiocese protesting the &ldquo;partisan political tone&rdquo; of the NCC letter and charging that the NCC had failed to adequately respond to the Antiochian Archdiocese&rsquo;s concerns either before or after its withdrawal; and <br /> WHEREAS, the NCC never expressed public regret for the letter; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, in a statement printed with his permission in Strange Yokefellows, the Very Rev. Olof Scott, Chairman of the Archdiocese&rsquo;s ecumenical office said that &ldquo;Strange Yokefellows fleshes out the primary reason for the withdrawal of the Antiochian Orthodox&rdquo; from the council; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> WHEREAS, other prominent endorsers of Strange Yokefellows include United Methodist theologian Thomas Oden, Bishop Robert Duncan of the Episcopal Church&rsquo;s Diocese of Pittsburgh, Eastern Orthodox columnist Frederica Mathewes-Green, and Bishop Basil of the Antiochian Orthodox Diocese of Wichita and Mid-America; and <br /> WHEREAS, the NCC&rsquo;s two main avenues for receiving funding from its member communions are the Ecumenical Commitment Fund (ECF) and Cognate funding; and <br /> WHEREAS, according to the General Council on Finance and Administration (GCFA) and the NCC&rsquo;s audited financial statements, The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s total contributions to these streams amounted to 35.6% of the NCC&rsquo;s total income from it member communions ($656118 out of $1,854,520) in the NCC&rsquo;s 2005-2006 fiscal year, 34.1% ($596,233 out of $1,750,332) in the 2004-2005 fiscal year, 31.4% ($566,459 out of $1,803,539) in 2003-2004, 32.6% ($597,123 out of $1,834,441) in 2002-2003, and 34.7% ($844,148 out of $2,431,879) in 2001-2002; and <br /> WHEREAS, NCC counts its constituency as the 45 million U.S. members of affiliated churches, of which United Methodists compose roughly 18%; and <br /> WHEREAS, we United Methodists have therefore been paying nearly twice our fair share to the NCC when declining U.S. membership and tightening budgets are straining our support of important ministries; and <br /> WHEREAS, such disproportionately large financial contributions to the NCC obligate us to scrutinize the NCC&rsquo;s stewardship; and <br /> WHEREAS, Strange Yokefellows found that despite heavy United Methodist funding, the NCC, by its 2004-2005 fiscal year, was receiving more funds from largely secular and political foundations and activist groups than from the NCC&rsquo;s member communions; and <br /> WHEREAS, during that fiscal year, only six of the NCC&rsquo;s sixteen top funders were actually church groups; and <br /> WHEREAS, recent non-church financial supporters of the NCC include the Sierra Club, the AARP, and the foundations of professing atheists Ted Turner and George Soros; and <br /> WHEREAS, since the release of Strange Yokefellows, the NCC has become more secretive about its finances, refusing to release previously available information; and <br /> WHEREAS, despite its alleged neutrality on homosexuality, NCC officials have repeatedly promoted opposition to The United Methodist Church&rsquo;s teaching, including their promotion of Edgar&rsquo;s recent book, Middle Church: Reclaiming the Moral Values of the Faithful Majority from the Religious Right, which advocates the ordination of self-avowed, practicing homosexuals, and their co-sponsoring &ldquo;Ecumenical Advocacy Days&rdquo; conferences in 2006 and 2007, which featured presentations by the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force; and <br /> WHEREAS, the NCC, despite the noble founding intentions, has sadly become a divisive force within the body of Christ in the United States, <br /> WHEREAS Church World Service, the international relief agency associated with the NCC, is now financially and administratively independent of the NCC; <br /> WHEREAS, few members of NCC-affiliated churches are very familiar with the council, and even fewer would connect the NCC to the ministry of their local congregation; and <br /> WHEREAS, any serious reform of the NCC may not be realistic; and <br /> Therefore, be it resolved, that the 2008 General Conference offers its prayers for God&rsquo;s will for the NCC to be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Laurie Goodstein and David Kirkpatrick, &ldquo;Conservative Group Amplifies Voice of Protestant Orthodoxy,&rdquo; <i>New York Times</i>, 22 May 2004.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /> </b></b>&nbsp;Pauline J.
