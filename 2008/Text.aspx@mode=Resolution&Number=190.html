<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>190. Goals and Recommendations for Full Participation<br> of All Women <br> </b></b><b></CENTER><CENTER></b><i>Recalling Our Historic Commitments <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>The historic General Conference of 1972 made a significant commitment to strengthening the participation of women at all levels of our church. To support this commitment, it created the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women &ldquo;to foster an ongoing awareness of the problems and issues related to the status of women and to stimulate progress reports on these issues.&rdquo;<br> The General Conference called for changes about theological, philosophical, and biblical interpretations and understandings about the role of women. It called for increased sensitivity to expectations for the achievement and contributions of women, and the issues of the rights of women. The General Conference further endorsed overcoming rigid sex role distinctions and discriminatory language, images, and practices in our own church life and work. <br> At that conference, only 16 years after the approval of full clergy rights and privileges for women (1956), the goals called for an openness and receptivity for women in the professional ministry and the utilization of men and women in elections and appointments at all levels of the church. Action plans included development of programs, evaluation measures, curriculum, doctrinal studies, and analysis of the particular problems and barriers faced by women. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Celebrating the Progress Made <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Now, approaching the new millennium, we as United Methodists celebrate significant efforts and progress made toward the goals and recommendations of our forebears in 1972. We have accomplished: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>studies and resources on women&rsquo;s roles in the Bible and in mission; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> programs and curriculum on changes needed in theological, biblical, and language interpretations; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> research and analyses on the barriers and problems facing women in the church; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> participation in the Ecumenical Decade of Churches in Solidarity with Women and growth in our understanding of the issues faced by women and young women worldwide; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> increase in the election of women to roles of leadership in the church, including the election of bishops, general secretaries and agency heads, general and jurisdictional conference delegates; increase in the appointment of women to lead, senior, or co-pastorates; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> significant increase in the number of women enrolling and graduating from seminary; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> studies, resources and training, and advocacy programs on the issue of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct; and establishment of annual conference commissions on the status and role of women providing monitoring and resources, leadership and policy development. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We thank God for the work of countless women, men, and young people carefully and spiritually building a more inclusive community of faith. We stand on their shoulders as we project the work before us into the next century, prayerfully aware of God&rsquo;s vision of justice and mutuality. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Theological Guidance for the Work Ahead <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Georgia Harkness in her book, Women in Church and Society, said, &ldquo;The women&rsquo;s movement is more than a struggle for &lsquo;women&rsquo;s rights&rsquo;. It is essentially a struggle for the recognition of women as persons of equal worth and status with men, and with equal opportunities according to their talents, training, and various forms of ability.&rdquo; Although some advances have been made for women&rsquo;s rights in recent years, patriarchy and sexism are still prevalent and much work remains to be done. In society, women continue to struggle for equality in employment, income, education, and leadership. The situation is comparable in the church. In many ways the church, the body of Christ, has followed the world, embracing and institutionalizing patriarchy, with its attendant sexism, rather than living out God&rsquo;s vision of justice and mutuality. <br> The vision of justice and mutuality is expressed throughout the Judeo-Christian scriptures and in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. God&rsquo;s intention for partnership and mutuality is evidenced in the creation stories when God made male and female in God&rsquo;s own image and then placed them in harmonious partnership in the garden. The consistent message of the prophets is a call for justice and for speaking out against inequalities, to stand with the oppressed and marginalized. In all the Gospels, Jesus reached out to women with tenderness and compassion. He treated women with dignity and redefined a woman&rsquo;s role. In having women as friends, disciples, and witnesses, Christ challenged the conventional sexism of his time. The apostle Paul affirmed this call of Christ to create and live in a world where the gifts of both women and men are celebrated and utilized, where &ldquo;there is neither male nor female, but all are one in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Galatians 3:28). Christ calls forth each generation to do the same in its time. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>Concerns and Issues That Face Us Now <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>Recalling this vision of justice and mutuality and recognizing the notable progress toward the commitment of that General Conference nearly 30 years ago, we confess the vision of full and equitable participation for all women is not yet realized. We have fallen short of the goals of 1972 and major barriers still exist. Testimony from women, men, and youth throughout the world demands we renew and revitalize our commitment to full and equitable participation of women. Some of those voices identify the concerns and issues now before us: <br> <i>(1) Voices from Churches Around the World: From Solidarity to Accountability.</i> This powerful letter from the closing of the Ecumenical Decade of Churches in Solidarity with Women (1998) called for initiatives to realize the full participation of all. It urged churches to create programs and opportunities that support and empower women, including monitoring church structures and practices &ldquo;so that all forms of exclusion are eradicated.&rdquo; It recommended providing theological and educational opportunities for women that honor their voices and experiences, gender studies and training, liturgies and gender language policies that affirm all, and policies that promote a balance of gender, age, and race in leadership and roles, honoring all people&rsquo;s cultural identities. <br> Participants in the 1998 Decade Festival in Harare, Zimbabwe also identified the barriers to women in theology. The women and men there experienced the healing and redemptive power of women speaking about God through their own experiences of violence, poverty, forgiveness, and empowerment in worship, liturgy, and song. There is a clear need for churches to value the contribution of women doing theology. <br> <i>(2) Voices from United Methodist Churches. </i>Research studies and information collected by our general agencies describe the concerns and experiences of women in leadership in startling detail. A summary of these findings follows and provides a litany of testimony that all is not as it could be: <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>Participation monitored by general agencies: <br> &nbsp; </i>Clergywomen. The General Board of Higher Education and Ministry, through the Division of Ordained Ministry, works for the full acceptance and empowerment of clergywomen throughout the church. At the end of this century, after 40 years of women having full clergy rights within the UMC, we note: In the U.S., approximately 13 percent of all ordained elders are women and about 13 percent of all ordained women in pastoral ministry are racial ethnic clergywomen. This is a low percentage compared to other professions (doctors = 21 percent women, lawyers = 25 percent women), to The United Methodist Church profile (women = over 50 percent of church membership), and to the society at large (women = 50 percent). Clergywomen, with the same number of years experience as men and with the same type of appointment, make 9 percent less than their male counterparts. This not only affects current economic situations for clergywomen, but also has an impact on their pension and retirement. <br> Women are beginning to fill leadership positions at the same rate or a little higher than the percentage of women elders. The percentage of women serving as district superintendents is approximately 15 percent and the women serving as bishops make up 8 percent of all bishops, active and retired. Only 2 percent of the clergy serving as lead pastors of churches of 1000 members or more are women. <br> In the Philippines, Africa, and Europe the percentage of ordained elders who are women varies greatly from conference to conference. While some women are serving as district superintendents there are no women episcopal leaders. <br> In the 1996 and the 2000 General Conference, clergywomen (elders) make up 20 percent of clergy delegates. Though the percentage did not change, the number of women elders decreased (women deacons make up the difference) and the number of delegations chaired by a clergywoman increased. <br> Women in the Master of Divinity (M.Div.) degree program at 13 United Methodist seminaries make up over 50 percent of all M.Div. degree students (the statistic has been over 40 percent for over 12 years); and, yet, the number of ordained women is still very low (less than 18 percent). <br> One of the major obstacles for clergywomen in acceptance and appointments is institutional or systemic sexism-bias against women that is inherent within a system. The United Methodist Church still perpetuates a hierarchical and linear model of ministry. Persons, particularly women, who tend to see ministry as a partnership and cyclical in style, often struggle in this system. Women are often told: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li>that they are &ldquo;leaving&rdquo; ministry when following a call to ministry outside the local church; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> that they need to &ldquo;start at the bottom&rdquo; when they return to local church ministry; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> that women are not accepted as clergy in some churches; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> that it is cheaper for a church and will help a budget if a woman is appointed; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul><li> that if women are interested in ministry outside the local church, they should consider lay ministry. <br> </li></ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The church is called to ask itself the difficult questions about the underlying theology and values that it reinforces and affirms in its policy and practices. <br> <i>Local Church Participation.</i> In its quadrennial survey of local churches in the U.S., the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women found these indications that more work is needed: Local church lay leaders in the study were 2:1 men to women; churches whose ushers are men or mostly men were 45 percent, 22 percent had all or mostly women ushers. <br> In the pulpit: 53 percent of the churches had one or no lay women preachers in the last year; of churches with male pastors: 77 percent had no clergywomen preaching in the last year. If lay liturgists were used, 35 percent of these churches use all or mostly males, 39 percent use all or mostly females; in language for God, 80 percent of these churches use all or mostly all-male language for God, in language for people, about 65 percent use inclusive terms like humankind or gender-neutral terms in their own language other than English. <br> Women fill roles of leadership most frequently in these committees (in order): education, staff parish relations, worship, administrative councils/boards, and evangelism/ witness/ outreach. <br> Areas where women participate the least in these local churches: finance, treasurer, missions and, lastly, trustees. <br> Issues important to women in the local church: 20 percent of the pastors responding didn&rsquo;t know. The most common responses pastors did name as important issues were missions, church growth and children. Then came family and parenting, domestic violence, and aging. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>Indicators from research and experience: <br> &nbsp; </i>The &ldquo;United Methodist Clergywomen Retention Study,&rdquo; conducted by the Anna Howard Shaw Center of the Boston University School of Theology</sub><sup>1</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;and co-sponsored by the Division of Ordained Ministry General Board of Higher Education and Ministry (GBHEM) studied written and interview responses of nearly 1400 UM clergywomen. UM clergywomen leave local church ministry at a 10 percent faster rate than clergymen, despite an overwhelming commitment to local church ministry. The data indicated four major reasons: lack of support from the hierarchical system, being unable to maintain one&rsquo;s integrity in the system, rejection from congregations/parishioners, and the conflict of family and pastoral responsibilities. Clearly this is a serious loss of gifts, graces, and our church&rsquo;s investment in these leaders. Five groups were identified as having responsibility for addressing this crisis in clergy leadership development: the appoint- <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; 1. &ldquo;United Methodist Clergywomen Retention Study,&rdquo; Anna Howard Shaw Center, Boston University School of Theology, Margaret S. Wiborg, Director; Elizabeth J. Collier, Primary Investigator. October 1997. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>ment system, conference leaders and clergy colleagues, congregations, seminaries, and clergywomen themselves. <br> &nbsp; Several of these points were underscored by two other studies. The University of Florida study of ordained United Methodist clergywomen across the U.S.</sub><sup>2</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;found that most UM clergywomen surveyed identified the high stress factors of &ldquo;pettiness, the patriarchy, and the pressures of ministry.&rdquo; The most common challenge to clergywomen is balancing work and family responsibilities given the expectations of congregations for 24-hour availability. The Clergywomen Retention Study stated it well in saying &ldquo;the church must ask itself why the traditional values and the theology of family do not apply to clergywomen as clergy but are applied to them as women.&rdquo;<br> A study initiated by the Women in Ministry Task Force of the Virginia Annual Conference</sub><sup>3</sup></sub>&nbsp;&nbsp;found that clergywomen more than their male colleagues prefer nontraditional roles in the church, and are more likely to feel the conference underutilizes their gifts and provides insufficient support. The study, conducted in 1998, found on the whole that clergywomen earn less than clergymen. Half of female clergy responding had salaries less than $30,000 (compared to 25 percent of male clergy), and half of the male clergy had salaries of $40,000 or more (compared to 15 percent of female clergy). <br> In a significant finding, the United Methodist Clergywomen Retention Study determined that a larger proportion of racial ethnic clergywomen have exited local church ministry (particularly among African and Asian American clergywomen), and their exits are more permanent than those of white clergywomen. Despite the fact that a larger proportion of racial ethnic clergywomen is committed to the church as an institution, almost twice the proportion of racial ethnic women as white women named &ldquo;lack of support from the hierarchical system&rdquo; as their primary reason for leaving the local church setting. The study makes the strongest implication that issues of racism are active in this loss of clergy leadership. On the whole, this study identifies details on hostile climates toward clergywomen for which our whole denomination must claim responsibility. <br> <i>Women&rsquo;s Congress: A Spiritual Journey.</i> During the 1993-1996 quadrennium, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; 2. Study of 190 UM Clergywomen by Jesse Schultz, Constance Shehan, and Marsha Wiggins Frame in August 1999, Sociological Focus. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; 3. Study of Clergy in the Virginia Annual Conference. 1997-1998 Virginia Commonwealth University Survey & Evaluation Research Laboratory 1-800-768-6040 ext. 316. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>reflected on the status and role of women in The United Methodist Church and identified that progress had been made on behalf of some, but not all women in The United Methodist Church. The Commission recognized the need to be vigilant in working on behalf of all women, particularly those marginalized by race, ethnicity, class, or economic status. What emerged was a vision for the next several years of the Commission&rsquo;s ministry: full and equal responsibility and participation for ALL women in the life and ministry of The United Methodist Church. <br> &nbsp; In 1999, The Women&rsquo;s Congress: A Spiritual Journey called forth women with potential for leadership who may not otherwise have opportunity for education and development in the church. More than 150 women gathered and were affirmed as daughters created in the image of God and as persons bearing gifts for life and service in God&rsquo;s creation. With the enthusiastic encouragement of those who participated in this spiritual journey, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women committed itself anew to be a catalyst for similar efforts to call forth women of gift and potential throughout The United Methodist Church. <br> <i>Racism/Sexism Task Force.</i> For several years, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women and the General Commission on Religion and Race have convened a Task Force on Racism/Sexism to explore and study the impact of the intersection of racism and sexism on racial ethnic women within the denomination. At the beginning of the 21st century, one might have expected that the issues of racism and sexism would be moot issues, both in the church and in the secular society. Unfortunately, this is not true, for this double-headed sin of racism/sexism still rears its un-Christian head in our lives. <br> A major three-year study was done by the research advisory group, Catalyst. They issued an article in July 1999 which states<br>&ldquo;ethnic women view employers as largely ineffective at combating racism and removing barriers in advancement.&rdquo; While this study was done in a secular setting, could not this also be said of United Methodists? <br> Racism and sexism place immeasurable pain and suffering on racial ethnic women. As a result, we all suffer, for when one of God&rsquo;s children is mistreated, the family is broken. The work of the Joint Task Force on Racism/Sexism is still very much needed to continue to bring awareness, understanding, and sensitivity to racism and sexism which are alive and well in The United Methodist Church. The work of the task force is still needed to enable our church to fully receive the gifts and graces of racial ethnic women as we strive to make the church inclusive and welcoming of all. <br> <i>United Methodist Women (UMW). </i>Over one million members strong, UMW has outstanding experience preparing women and youth to serve in ministry, and mission. The Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries has historically called attention to gaps in the participation of women in the church, especially in positions in finance, treasury, and trusteeship in local congregations. They have also identified the gap in participation of young women in all levels of church life and have embarked on a comprehensive recruitment, training, and mission opportunity program targeting teen, college, and university women. <br> Congregations&rsquo; inability to utilize the recruited and trained women may be a barrier to progress in closing these gaps. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><CENTER><i>A Vision of Parity and Equitable Treatment <br> </i></i></CENTER>&nbsp; </i>In The United Methodist Church we have used various tools to set goals for full and equitable participation of women in all levels of our church. For a time, we used encouragement; then for a time we used numerical participation targets. From the indicators described above, we need more and better tools to reach our commitment for full participation. The tool of &ldquo;parity&rdquo; may be such a tool. <br> Parity in participation is reached when participation of a category of individual is comparable to that category&rsquo;s representation in the group as a whole. For example, if women represent 56 percent of the membership of The United Methodist Church in an annual or central conference, then parity in women in clergy leadership is reached when clergywomen represent 56 percent of that annual or central conference clergy membership. Parity is a flexible measurement that can be applied to General Conference Committee officers, or local church administrative council membership, or to conference delegations to General Conference. <br> We have learned over the last 30 years in this journey toward full and equitable participation that it is not enough to be present at the table where decisions are made. It is not enough to be a member of a committee or a board where programs and policies are shaped. Inequities and unjust treatment at the table or in the committee room can create barriers to full participation. We must pay special attention to the hospitality and affirmation that are offered to all who are given access. What are the environments of our church systems that could prevent someone&rsquo;s participation and contributions? <br> <i>Therefore</i> the General Conference recommits The United Methodist Church to these recommendations for strengthening the participation of youth, young adult, and adult women in the church: <br> 1. That conference boards of ordained ministry take action with cabinets to:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reach an increased proportion of women in all levels of professional ministry; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; build a more hospitable climate in local churches to receive women as clergy and lay employees; and <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; create a more favorable setting for the appointment of racial ethnic clergywomen and clergy couples, paying particular attention in clergywomen&rsquo;s appointments to salary range equity, size of congregation and/or worship attendance, and provisions for family leave. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. That all nominating committees in local churches, and annual, jurisdictional, central and General conferences give attention to the nomination of women for membership and leadership in significant numbers according to parity (participation comparable to representation in the body as a whole). <br> 3. That the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women in cooperation with appropriate general agencies collect data on the participation of laywomen across the church with particular emphasis on racial ethnic women. This data will be used in preparation for analyzing women&rsquo;s participation at various levels of church life and work, and for supporting networks of women seeking ministry settings in which to serve. <br> 4. That the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women advocate that particular attention be given by the appropriate agencies and institutions to the problems and barriers faced by women in racial and ethnic groups within our churches, including clergywomen. <br> 5. That general program agencies develop new avenues of participation for younger adult members of the church, particularly youth and young adult women, and that these efforts include staff time and financial resources needed. And that the conferences support the efforts of these agencies with youth and young adult women. <br> 6. That the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry conduct follow-up study and action to address the reasons clergywomen leave local church ministry. That the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry continue to work toward the full acceptance and empowerment of clergywomen including preparation of resources and action plans for cabinets, annual conference leadership, boards of ordained ministry, and clergywomen that address the reasons women leave local church ministry; and, that the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry specifically: <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; study the disparities for racial ethnic clergywomen and prepare action plans for the elimination of racism and sexism in regards to clergywomen; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; continue to provide resources for clergywomen including national and international gatherings; and, <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; coordinate with other United Methodist general church agencies and centers in the gathering of oral and written history of clergywomen from 1956 through 2006. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7. That the training for new district superintendents address strategies and awareness needed to support and retain clergywomen in local church ministries, particularly racial ethnic clergywomen in the different cultural traditions in our churches. <br> 8. That central conferences be encouraged to move forward in their efforts to eradicate barriers to full and equitable participation of women in their programs and ministry settings, utilizing structures, channels and methods appropriate to these settings. <br> 9. That the General Council on Finance and Administration include in its annual statistical report requests for information on the participation of persons by gender and race in our local churches and conferences. <br> 10. That the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women and the General Commission on Religion and Race continue to work cooperatively on the issues of the intersection of race and gender. <br> 11. That the General Commission on Religion and Race, the General Commission on the Status and Role of Women, the Women&rsquo;s Division of the General Board of Global Ministries, and the General Board of Higher Education and Ministry Division of Ordained Ministry explore the feasibility of conducting a consultation with lay and clergy women during the 2001-2004 quadrennium on progress and plans toward full and equitable participation of women in The United Methodist Church, with recommendations from the consultation to be infused into the work of these agencies and units. <br> </ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="right"><b>ADOPTED 2000 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principles, ¶ 163. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
