(See ¶161.K.) <br /> Governmental laws and regulations do not provide all the guidance required by the informed Christian conscience.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, <strike> a</strike>&nbsp;decision<b>s</b> <strike> concerning abortion</strike>&nbsp;should be made only after thoughtful and prayerful consideration by the parties involved, with medical, pastoral, and other appropriate counsel. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Scripture is primary (¶104).&nbsp;&nbsp;Scripture clearly defines life as beginning in the womb (Psalm 139:13-15; Jeremiah 1:5) and the ending of that life as wrong (Exodus 20:13).&nbsp;&nbsp;The Book of Discipline should conform to Scripture.&nbsp;&nbsp;John Wesley would vote for this petition saying, &ldquo;My ground is the Bible.&rdquo;<br /> <br /></p></td>
