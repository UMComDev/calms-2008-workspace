<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF"><CENTER><b>312. Opposition to Israeli Settlements in Palestinian Land <br> </b></b><b></CENTER>&nbsp; </b>We join with Palestinian Christians as well as our Jewish and Muslim brothers and sisters in feeling a deep sense of rootedness to the land that has special meaning for our three religious traditions. We celebrate the diversity of religious customs and traditions throughout the Middle East. <br> Jerusalem is sacred to all the children of Abraham: Jews, Muslims, and Christians. We have a vision of a shared Jerusalem as a city of peace and reconciliation, where indigenous Palestinians and Israelis can live as neighbors and, along with visitors and tourists, have access to holy sites and exercise freedom of religious expression. The peaceful resolution of Jerusalem&rsquo;s status is crucial to the success of the whole process of making a just and lasting peace between Palestinians and Israelis. <br> We seek for all people in the region an end to military occupation, freedom from violence, and full respect for the human rights of all under international law. <br> Whereas, the prophet Isaiah cautioned against coveting the lands and homes of one&rsquo;s neighbors: &ldquo;Ah, you who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is room for no one but you, and you are left to live alone in the midst of the land!&rdquo;<i> </i>(Isaiah 5:8); and <br> Whereas, the continuing confiscation of Palestinian land for construction of settlements and the building of a separation wall violates basic understanding of human rights, subverts the peace process, destroys the hope of both Israelis and Palestinians who are working for and longing for peace, and fosters a sense of desperation that can only lead to further violence; and <br> Whereas, continued and often intensified closures, curfews, dehumanizing check points, home demolitions, uprooted trees, bulldozed fields, and confiscation of Palestinian land and water by the government of Israel have devastated economic infrastructure and development in the West Bank and Gaza, have caused a massive deterioration of the living standards of all Palestinians... and an increasing sense of hopelessness and frustration; and <br> Whereas, targeted assassinations, suicide bombings, and attacks against civilians by both Israelis and Palestinians heighten the fear and suffering of all; and <br> Whereas, people in the United States, through their taxes, provide several billion dollars in economic and military assistance to the State of Israel each year, which allows for the building of bypass roads and settlements that are illegal according to the Fourth Geneva Convention; <br> Whereas, the church continues to work with ecumenical and interfaith bodies to advocate for Palestinian self-determination and an end to Israeli occupation; to affirm Israel&rsquo;s right to exist within secure borders; to affirm the right of return for Palestinian refugees under international law; to call for region-wide disarmament; to urge Israelis and Palestinians to stop human rights violations and attacks on civilians, such as targeted assassinations and suicide bombings; and to urge the U.S. government to initiate an arms embargo on the entire Middle East region; <br> <i>Therefore, be it resolved</i>, that The United Methodist Church opposes continued military occupation of the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem, the confiscation of Palestinian land and water resources, the destruction of Palestinian homes, the continued building of illegal Jewish settlements, and any vision of a &ldquo;Greater Israel&rdquo; that includes the occupied territories and the whole of Jerusalem and its surroundings. <br> <i>Be it further resolved</i>, that we urge the U.S. government to end all military aid to the region, and second to redistribute the large amount of aid now given to Israel and Egypt; to support economic development efforts of nongovernmental organizations throughout the region, including religious institutions, human rights groups, labor unions, and professional groups within Palestinian communities. <br> The United Methodist Church requests that the government of the United States, working in cooperation with the United Nations and other nations, urge the state of Israel to: <br> 1. cease the confiscation of Palestinian lands and water for any reason; <br> 2. cease the building of new, or expansion of existing, settlements and/or bypass roads in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem; <br> 3. lift the closures and curfews on all Palestinian towns by completely withdrawing Israeli military forces to the Green Line (the 1948 ceasefire line between Israel and the West Bank); <br> 4. dismantle that segment of the Wall of Separation constructed since May 2002 that is not being built on the Green Line but on Palestinian land that is separating Palestinian farmers from their fields. <br> We also urge the Palestinian Authority and all Palestinian religious leaders to continue to publicly condemn violence against Israeli civilians and to use nonviolent acts of disobedience to resist the occupation and the illegal settlements. <br> We urge all United Methodists in the U.S. to: <br> 1. advocate with the U.S. administration and Congress to implement the above steps; <br> 2. encourage members of each congregation to study the Israeli-Palestinian conflict from all perspectives by inviting speakers to church events, reading books, using audio-visual resources in educational forums, and getting information from Web sites. <br> 3. provide financial support to the Palestinian people through contributions to the General Board of Global Ministries;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> 4. support, and participate in, the work of international peace and human rights organizations to provide protection for Palestinians and Israelis seeking nonviolently to end the occupation; and <br> 5. reach out to local synagogues, mosques, and Christian faith groups by engaging in interfaith and ecumenical dialogue on how to promote justice and peace in the Holy Land; and&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> That the General Board of Global Ministries, working together with the General Board of Church & Society and interfaith organizations, develop advocacy packets for use in local congregations to promote a just and lasting peace and human rights for all in the region. <br> <p align="right"><b>Adopted 2004 <br> </b></b></p></b><i>See</i> Social Principle, Â¶ 165. <br> </i></i>&nbsp;
