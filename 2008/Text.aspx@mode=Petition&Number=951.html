Selection and Assignment <br /> Inasmuch as the district superintendency is an extension of the general superintendency, the bishop shall appoint elders to serve as district superintendents. Prior to each appointment, the bishop shall consult with the cabinet and the committee on district superintendency of the district to which the new superintendent will be assigned (¶ 431) for the purpose of determining leadership needs of the annual conference and the district (¶¶ 401-402). <b>The appointments shall be made from among those elected by the annual conference one year prior to the time that the district superintendent(s) take(s) office. Using a written ballot based on nominations from the floor of the clergy session, by a majority vote of the clergy of the conference, the conference shall select twice as many elders as are required for the anticipated openings the following year if more than one will be required. If only one opening in the Cabinet is expected, the conference shall elect three. Each elder elected shall be invited to attend three or more Cabinet meetings and choose a superintendent to be mentor for the year as well as take advantage of training opportunities for superintendents. The election is for one year and, while the pastor is under other appointment, it shall be a training opportunity. At the appropriate time during that year, after due consultations, the bishop shall appoint the number of district superintendents needed from among those elected by the Conference to take office following the next annual conference or ad interim, if necessary. </b>&nbsp; In the selection of superintendents, bishops shall give due consideration to the inclusiveness of The United Methodist Church with respect to sex, race, national origin, physical challenge, and age, except for the provisions of mandatory retirement. <br /> <br /></p><h2>Rationale</h2><p>Because Cabinets under Fair Process are officers in that system as well as having authority to bring complaints, it would be wise to have superintendents chosen by some kind of conference-based nomination and election.&nbsp;&nbsp;The West German Conference of the Evangelisch-Methodistische Freikirche uses such election successfully as did the EUBs.<br /><br /></p></td>
