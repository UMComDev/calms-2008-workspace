<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">&nbsp;&nbsp;¶&nbsp; <b>410.</b> <i>Status of Retired Bishops</i>-A retired bishop is a bishop of the Church in every respect and continues to function as a member of the Council of Bishops in accordance with the Constitution and other provisions of the <i>Discipline</i>. <br> 1. Retired bishops may participate in the Council of Bishops and its committees, but without vote. They may preside over sessions of an annual conference, provisional annual conference, or mission if requested to do so by the bishop assigned to that conference, or in the event of that bishop&rsquo;s incapacity, by the president of the College of Bishops to which the conference is related. Retired bishops elected by the Council of Bishops may serve as the executive secretary and the ecumenical officer of the Council. In emergency situations, where the resident bishop is unable to preside, the College of Bishops shall assign an effective or retired bishop to preside over the sessions of<br> the annual conference (¶&nbsp;48). They may not make appointments or preside at the jurisdiction or central conference. However, when a retired bishop is appointed by the Council of Bishops to a vacant episcopal area or parts of an area under the provisions of ¶¶&nbsp;410.3, 411.1, or 411.3, that bishop may function as a bishop in the effective relationship.</sub><sup>7</sup></sub><br> 2. A retired bishop may be considered a member of an annual conference, without vote, for purposes of appointment to a local charge within the said conference. <br> 3. A bishop retired under ¶&nbsp;409.1, .2 above may be appointed by the Council of Bishops upon recommendation of the involved College of Bishops to presidential responsibility for temporary service in an area in the case of death, resignation, disability, or procedure involving a resident bishop (¶&nbsp;2703.1). This appointment shall not continue beyond the next jurisdictional or central conference. <br> 7. <i>See</i> Judicial Council Decision 248. <br>
